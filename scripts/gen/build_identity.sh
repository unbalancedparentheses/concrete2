# Emit `Concrete/BuildIdentity.lean` — the identity of the compiler BUILD, embedded in the binary.
#
# WHY EMBEDDED RATHER THAN COMPUTED AT RUN TIME. A receipt must name the compiler that produced it.
# Three earlier attempts named something else:
#
#   `git status --porcelain`  — repository state at REPORT time. Any untracked file invalidated every
#                               receipt, and a binary built dirty then cleaned reported clean.
#   `git rev-parse HEAD`      — the checkout at REPORT time. A binary built from commit A claims B the
#                               moment the checkout moves, and a binary built from uncommitted sources
#                               claims whatever happens to be checked out.
#   `sha256sum /proc/self/exe`— the running executable, which is the right OBJECT, but neither
#                               `/proc/self/exe` nor GNU `sha256sum` exists on macOS, an active CI
#                               platform. Receipt issuance simply refused there.
#
# A digest computed AT BUILD TIME over the compiler's own sources travels with the binary. It is
# portable, costs nothing at run time, and is a property of the artifact rather than of the tree the
# artifact is later pointed at. Uncommitted sources are covered for free — the generator digests the
# working tree, not a commit.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated because a receipt that overclaims is worse than one that binds less:
# a binary PATCHED AFTER BUILD keeps the constant its sources produced. This identifies the build, not
# the bytes on disk. Detecting post-build tampering needs an executable digest, which needs a portable
# in-process hash of a 178 MB file — not available today.
#
# STALENESS IS A GATE FAILURE, not a silent wrong answer: `check_build_identity_freshness.sh`
# re-derives this and fails on disagreement, the same discipline `ClassificationTable` is held to.

# Generated compiler build identity — do not edit

Emitted by \`scripts/gen/build_identity.sh\` from the compiler's own sources. A receipt binds this to
name the compiler that produced it.

EMBEDDED AT BUILD TIME on purpose. Identities derived from the repository at REPORT time —
\`git status\`, \`git rev-parse HEAD\` — describe the tree the binary is later pointed at rather than
the binary, and are wrong in both directions: a binary built from one commit claims another once the
checkout moves, and a binary built from uncommitted sources claims whatever is checked out. This
value travels with the artifact.

A run-time digest of the executable would be strictly stronger and is not portable: neither
\`/proc/self/exe\` nor GNU \`sha256sum\` exists on macOS, which is an active CI platform, and hashing
a 178 MB binary in-process is not viable with the in-repo SHA-256. **Known limit: a binary patched
after build keeps the constant its sources produced.** This identifies the BUILD, not the bytes.

Staleness is a gate failure rather than a silent wrong answer:
\`check_build_identity_freshness.sh\` re-derives this and fails on disagreement.
