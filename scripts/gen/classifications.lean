-- Generator for `Concrete/Proof/ClassificationTable.lean`. Do not hand-edit the OUTPUT.
--
-- Classification reads a theorem's ELABORATED TYPE, which needs the proof modules imported.
-- The compiler imports neither and cannot: `Examples` imports `Concrete`, so importing the
-- proofs from `Concrete` would be a cycle. The answer is computed here and checked in as data.
--
-- THE NAME SET IS THE UNION OF BOTH WAYS A PROOF CAN BE ATTACHED, and getting that wrong is
-- how the first version of this table looked complete while missing a third of the corpus:
--
--   * `Proof.provedFunctions` — the hardcoded table;
--   * `#[proof_by(...)]` / `#[ensures_proof(...)]` in SOURCE — spliced in below by
--     `scripts/gen/refresh_classifications.sh`, which greps them from examples/.
--
-- `main.verify_message` was `proved` with a REFUSING dependency root because only the first
-- set was enumerated. Its theorem classifies as `body` perfectly well; nobody had asked.

-- Regenerate: bash scripts/gen/refresh_classifications.sh
