  # BOTH ATTESTATION SECTIONS. Subject rows and dependency attestations are different populations

  # is one file. Refusal rows (`!!`) are not references and are not emitted: a request the manifest
  # refused has nothing to select.
  #
  # DEDUPED on (table, package, module, declaration, implementation). The same callee is legitimately
  # both a subject of its table and the target of a body edge, and emitting the symbol twice would not
  # compile. Deduping on anything less would silently drop a real distinction: two packages, or two
  # implementations of one declaration, are different references and must both exist.
  # SORTED BEFORE DEDUPE, under `LC_ALL=C`, for the same reason `build_identity.sh`
  # sorts its inventory: the emitted file is compared BYTE FOR BYTE by
  # `check_attestation_manifest.sh`, so an order inherited from the manifest's
  # enumeration makes that gate a function of the environment rather than of content.
  # It did: one machine ordered `block_to_words_at` before `block_to_words` and the
  # gate reported a correct tree as STALE, advising a regeneration that would have
  # committed that machine's order and broken CI.
