# PROCESS IDENTITY BY CONSTRUCTION, ATTACKED DIRECTLY.
#
# The campaign supervisor may publish only when nothing from the run is still executing: evidence
# written after the census would be described by an artifact that never saw it. Four attempts at
# that check shipped broken, and every one of them was found by RUNNING a campaign, not by reading:
#
#   1. `pgrep -P $$` sees one generation, and the campaign child is already reaped by then, so a
#      surviving grandchild is reparented away and never appears.
#   2. matching command lines for the repository path also matched the LAUNCHER of the run.
#   3. matching them for the workspace path matched the supervisor itself, which runs
#      `bash /tmp/concrete-mut.<pid>.../driver.sh`, and any shell whose command line merely
#      CONTAINED the search string.
#   4. /proc ancestry is correct on Linux and ABSENT on macOS — and this repository has already
#      taken a macOS outage from depending on /proc.
#
# Attempts 2, 3 and 4 refused clean runs. A check that always fires carries no more information than
# one that never does; both are indistinguishable from an absent check to anything reading results.
#
# The rule is now structural: the child is launched into its own session, so its process-group id is
# its pid, the supervisor and every ancestor are outside that group, and liveness is whatever the
# kernel says about that group. No patterns, no exclusion lists, nothing depending on how a worker
# spells its command line. Designed using portable POSIX mechanisms; whether Linux and macOS agree
# is established by running this gate on both in CI, not by claiming it here.
