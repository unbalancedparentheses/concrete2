# THE V1 -> V2 SUBJECT-DIGEST MIGRATION, DRY RUN (R-0004 package 3).
#
# Every stored `#[proof_fingerprint]` in the corpus is a V1 value: a body-only fingerprint answering
# a weaker question than the V2 subject digest, which also binds the declaration's signature,
# contracts, capabilities and constant environment. Activating V2 makes every stored V1 value NOT
# COMPARABLE at once — correctly — so activation without migration would turn the corpus
# `needs_recheck` in a single commit.
#
# THIS GATE IS ABOUT THE DENOMINATOR. A migration plan that lists only what it would change is
# indistinguishable from one that silently skips things, so the population must RECONCILE:
#
#     stored fingerprints in code  =  plan rows  +  every exclusion, named
#
# WHAT CANNOT BE MIGRATED MATTERS MORE THAN WHAT CAN. A stale link is pinned to a body that no longer
# exists; recording the CURRENT digest for it would assert that a proof was established against a
# body it was never checked against — manufacturing freshness, which is the exact forgery this
# package exists to prevent.
