# Known-wrong corpus gate — the counterexample fixtures for OPEN holes.
#
# H23 and H24 are documented with reproductions in examples/. Those fixtures are `skip`
# in the example manifest, because the corpus checks that programs succeed and these
# deliberately do not. Skipped means nothing runs them, and a counterexample fixture that
# silently stops reproducing is worse than none: the hole stays open, the docs keep citing
# a file that no longer demonstrates it, and nobody finds out.
#
# So this gate asserts each fixture STILL EXHIBITS the behaviour its hole documents.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE "FIXING" A FAILURE HERE. A red assertion means the documented
# behaviour changed. That is usually GOOD NEWS — the hole got fixed — and the correct
# response is to update docs/verification/KNOWN_HOLES.md and flip the assertion into its
# post-fix form, NOT to make the fixture wrong again. These assertions are written to be
# inverted when R-0461 / R-0464 land; each one names what it should become.
