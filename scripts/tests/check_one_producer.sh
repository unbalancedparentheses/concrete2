# ONE PRODUCER PER FACT — generalized from the obligation-record guard to a registry.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, concretely. "Two producers of one fact" is named as a defect class 14 times
# across this codebase and ROADMAP.md. It is enforced for exactly one fact
# (check_obligation_single_truth_source.sh, the obligation record). Everywhere else it lives in
# prose — and prose is not a gate.
#
# The cost of that was measured on 2026-08-13. `Report.lean:1763` states the rule for `depRoot`
# ("Both consumers read `ProofCore.dependencyNodesOf`, so there is one set of nodes rather than a
# Report-local rebuild — two builders is how a second, weaker answer appears"). Three lines away,
# `shadowEdgeKinds` violated it: it derived edge kinds as `if isTrusted then "trusted" else
# "unclassified"`, consulting no classification table, so it reported `unclassified` for edges the
# hand-back had classified `body`. Nothing checked. The stale line then caused a WRONG DIAGNOSIS —
# a coverage fail-open was reported, and root coverage was predicted to fall from 62/64 to ~53/64,
# when in fact the roots were correct and the report was lying. Two producers did not just risk
# divergence; they produced a false finding that was committed and had to be retracted.
#
# TWO ENTRY KINDS, because the class has two shapes:
#
#   FORMULA  a digest/preimage expression that must exist in exactly ONE file. A second copy is a
#            second answer to "did this change", and the copies drift silently because both are
#            plausible.
#   OWNERS   a derived fact (a kind, a currency decision, a node set) whose definition and
#            permitted consumers are named. A new consumer is not automatically wrong, but it must
#            be looked at — the failure names the file so the question is forced.
#
# CODE REFERENCES ONLY, via lib/code_refs.sh. A first version of a sibling guard grepped raw text
# and fired on a doc comment; and while writing THIS gate, a comment in `Report.lean` explaining
# the fix above made `classifiedEdgeOf` look like it had a consumer there. Documenting a boundary is
# not crossing it. The stripper is self-tested below before any verdict uses it, because narrowing
# what a guard reads is only safe if it still fires.

# R-0479 — A FACT IS NEVER DEFAULTED TO A VALID VALUE OF ITSELF.
#
# Housed here because it is the same family as one-producer: both are ways a fact can be FAKED. But
# it is a distinct failure mode, and the more deceptive one. One-producer catches a second
# computation of a fact; this catches a single producer that did not look and returned a plausible
# in-domain value anyway. Such a value survives every type check and every set-comparison gate,
# because it IS a legal value — it is simply not this one.
#
# The instance that motivated it: `shadowEdgeKinds` returned `unclassified`, a real
# `DependencyEdge`, having consulted no classifier, and so produced a false finding rather than an
# obvious wrong answer. The instance this check found: `Report.lean` had
# `(pc.obligations.find? ...).map (·.status.canonical) |>.getD "missing"`, and `missing` is a real
# canonical status (`.notProved => "missing"`), so "no obligation record" rendered identically to
# "an obligation exists and is missing".
#
# NOTE ON WHAT IS *NOT* A VIOLATION: a COMPUTED branch may legitimately yield a domain value —
# `if dep.isEmpty then ("none", "missing", "")` is a real determination that the obligation is
# missing, not a failed lookup being papered over. This checks `.getD` defaults specifically,
# because that is the failed-lookup shape.
echo "=== no fact is defaulted to a valid value of itself ==="

# Domain values that must never appear as a `.getD` default: canonical obligation statuses and
# dependency-edge kinds. Both sets are small, closed, and meaningful — which is exactly what makes
# a default drawn from them indistinguishable from a real answer.
#
# THIS LIST IS OVER-STRICT BY DESIGN, and the escape hatch is deliberate. The real test is not
# membership in a vocabulary but whether the default ASSERTS something the failed read did not
# establish. Those come apart at the BOTTOM of an assurance ladder: `SourceCorrespondence.missing`
# (see docs/verification/EVIDENCE_ARCHITECTURE.md) means exactly "no correspondence evidence established", so a
# failed read defaulting to it asserts nothing and is fail-closed — legitimate, unlike obligation
# `missing`, which describes an existing record whose proof is absent.
#
# So when the typed-evidence objects land, this check WILL reject a correct default. The fix is an
# explicit allowlist entry naming the type and stating why its ⊥ is safe. NOT deleting the check, and
# NOT renaming the value to evade it. `missing` already means different things in two vocabularies,
# which is why the justification has to be per type rather than per name.
