# VC-bridge register gate.
#
# docs/VC_BRIDGE_REGISTER.md inventories the Core→obligation lowering rule by rule:
# what each emits, assumes, rejects, which example forced it, and the theorem that
# will discharge it. That bridge is the one every runtime-safety claim rests on, and
# the one multi-kernel agreement provably cannot check — all kernels check the SAME
# lowered proposition, so a mis-lowering yields unanimous agreement on the wrong
# formula.
#
# This gate keeps the register honest in both directions:
#   * every obligation-family generator in the code has a register row, so a new
#     family cannot ship undocumented;
#   * every row names a real generator, so the register cannot accumulate rows for
#     rules that no longer exist (the drift direction docs usually fail in).
#
# Cheap: pure grep, no build, no provers.
