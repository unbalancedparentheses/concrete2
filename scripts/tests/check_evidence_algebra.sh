# Register C gate — the evidence algebra (Concrete/Report/Evidence.lean).
#
# Registers A (obligation sufficiency) and B (transformation soundness) are about
# program semantics and are years of work. Register C is about the evidence DATA
# STRUCTURE, so its rows are dischargeable now — and they are discharged as
# compile-time theorems, not tests. A green build is the proof; this gate exists to
# make deleting or weakening a row LOUD rather than silent, and to lock the
# structural properties a theorem cannot state (one construction site, wired
# consumers, no axiom escape hatches).
#
# Why the rows matter, concretely: H23 shipped a guaranteed out-of-bounds access as
# `proved_by_multi_kernel (3: lean, rocq, isabelle)` because an obligation's status
# was computed without consulting the hypotheses it rested on. C2/C2'/C3 make that
# combination unrepresentable rather than merely wrong.
