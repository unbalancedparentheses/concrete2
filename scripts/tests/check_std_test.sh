# Phase 7 step 5 gate: the std.test oracle/helper layer discipline.
#
#   - basic expect_* helpers are SILENT, capability-free, allocation-free
#     (bool-returning; no output on pass or fail — messaging is the caller's,
#     via assert_* which carry visible Console authority)
#   - assert_* failures report a STABLE message shape; passes are silent
#   - the oracle path (expect_sink/sink_matches) byte-compares a Writer sink —
#     test output and documented output are one mechanism
#   - NOT an xUnit framework: no suites/fixtures/setup-teardown surface
