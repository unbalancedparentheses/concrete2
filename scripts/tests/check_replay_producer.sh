# KERNEL REPLAY AS A TYPED SERVICE (R-0004 package 3).
#
# "Did the Lean kernel accept this?" is the question every replay-backed receipt rests on. Until
# 2026-08-16 it had no answerer, only a rendering: the check lived INLINE in `compileAndReport`,
# entangled with that function's `reportJson` parameter, and every failure path PRINTED and returned
# an exit code. Nothing else could ask — not receipt minting, not the link migration, not a test —
# so a second caller would have had to write a second answer to the same question.
#
# This gate holds the extracted producer to the properties that make its answer usable as evidence
# rather than as output. Two of them are the whole point and are asserted in both directions:
#
#   * A REFUSAL IS A VALUE. "No kernel ran" and "the kernel said no" are opposite facts, and a
#     minting path that cannot tell them apart records a refusal as a pass.
#   * AN EMPTY REQUEST IS REFUSED, NOT SATISFIED. `checks.all accepted` is TRUE over an empty list.
#     A vacuous "all accepted" is precisely the answer a minting authority must never receive.
#
# Every negative below is paired with a live positive control, because a producer that refused
# everything would satisfy the negatives alone.
