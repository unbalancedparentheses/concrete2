# IDENTITY FREEZE — the pre-migration population, pinned exactly.
#
# The five-way identity separation replaces one over-bound `PackageIdentity` with
# PackageScopeIdentity / PackageArtifactIdentity / ResolutionContextIdentity, and rescopes
# `DefinitionIdentity` onto the first of those. That migration must be ATOMIC and must reproduce the
# COMPLETE reference population — so the population has to be a measured number before anything
# moves, not a number recovered afterwards from whatever survived.
#
# WHY A GATE RATHER THAN A NOTE. The last identity change moved every package in the repository and
# stranded 168 lines of attestations; the count of references never changed, so a count-only check
# would have called it healthy. What makes a freeze useful is that a DIFFERENCE fails loudly while
# the old scheme is still in place, so "the migration reproduced the population" is checkable rather
# than asserted.
#
# These numbers are expected to change exactly once, in the migration commit, together with the
# generator, the references, the consumers and the deletion of the old symbols. A change to any of
# them at any other time is drift and should fail here.
