# MUTATION ANCHORS — every mutation's target text still exists in its file.
#
# The mutation harness is what establishes that the other gates are load-bearing, so an
# inert mutation costs more than an ordinary test: it removes the evidence that some gate
# does any work, and removes it silently.
#
# A mutation whose MUT_OLD no longer appears in MUT_FILE cannot be applied. The harness
# prints "SKIPPED (pattern not found in file)" and, until 2026-08-06, still exited 0. Two
# things made that invisible for a long time:
#
#   1. the harness rebuilds the compiler twice per mutation, so it is expensive and is NOT
#      run in CI — nothing was checking;
#   2. anchors rot from ordinary refactors. Measured 2026-08-06: 4 of 77 were stale. Three
#      broke when the V2 producer cutover changed `return .call ...` into
#      `return ElaboratedExprV2.mk (CExpr.call ...)`; a fourth broke when R-0455 turned a
#      literal Rocq proof template into an interpolated one.
#
# This gate is the cheap half of that: pure string presence, no builds, no mutations, runs
# in seconds on every push. It cannot tell you a mutation is KILLED — only that it is still
# capable of being applied at all. That is the property that was silently lost.

# implementations of "does this anchor identify a site", the weaker one was the gate, and on
# 2026-08-21 strengthening the weak copy merely duplicated a check the authority already performed
# correctly. A gate must not be a second opinion about the thing it is checking.
