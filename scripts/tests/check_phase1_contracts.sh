# Phase 1 source-contract VALIDATION ARTIFACT (ROADMAP Phase 1 #9).
#
# The single gate for the whole source-contract surface. It:
#   1. runs the two contract sub-gates (negatives+positive+hmac anchor, stability);
#   2. asserts one GOLDEN REPORT SNAPSHOT per contract failure class is
#      byte-identical (drift is real signal — a wording/behaviour change must be
#      reflected deliberately);
#   3. checks the README explains every fixture.
#
# Update snapshots deliberately:
#   UPDATE_PHASE1_SNAPSHOTS=1 bash scripts/tests/check_phase1_contracts.sh
#
# See examples/contract_negatives/README.md for the per-class explanation and
# Concrete/Proof/ProofSoundness.lean (R-22..R-28) for the soundness justification.

# standard library's contracts and the golden file ends up depending on every contract in std/.
# The attribution message below explains such a drift after it happens; this removes the
# dependency so it does not happen. Entries for other modules are dropped from the COMPARISON
# only — the report itself still shows them, so no coverage is lost from what a user sees.
#
# The report is entry-structured: `===` section headers, then qualified `module.fn` entries at
# column 0, each followed by indented detail. Keep a header always; keep an entry block iff its
# module is one of ours.
