# The migration manifest: every stored proof link joined to the subject it must migrate to.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A GATE. The measurement "39 of 39 migration subjects digest" was run once
# by hand, from an ad-hoc shell loop, and written into the roadmap as though it were established.
# It was not: nothing reproduced it, nothing would notice if it stopped being true, and a number
# in prose is not a measurement — it is a memory of one. This file is that loop, committed, with
# the join made exact.
#
# TWO DENOMINATORS, RECONCILED. They are different things and quoting either alone misleads:
#
#   * 44 STORED LINKS — `#[proof_fingerprint]` annotations across the selected migration
#     examples. This is what `check_v1_fingerprint_golden.sh` establishes and what the step-7
#     migration must rewrite, one by one.
#   * 64 UNIQUE SUBJECTS — the callables in the files those links live in. The hand-run number
#     recorded in the roadmap was 39, from a narrower file set (`examples/*/src/main.con` only);
#     that is the third way this denominator has been miscounted, and the reason the count now
#     comes from a gate instead of a memory.
#
# A gate that checked only the subject count would miss a link that is dangling (attached to no
# subject) or duplicated; one that checked only the link count would miss a subject whose body is
# refused. So both are asserted, and so is the join between them.
#
# PER SUBJECT, NOT IN AGGREGATE. An earlier version compared totals — "N digested, M refused, T
# total" — which false-greens exactly when it matters: one refused subject wrongly receiving a
# digest while a complete one is missing its own cancels out in a sum. Each subject is checked
# against its own body line.
