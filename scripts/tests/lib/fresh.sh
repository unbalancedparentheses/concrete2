# Stale-compiler-artifact guard.
#
# Every gate that runs the compiler tests whatever binary happens to be on disk. When that binary
# predates the checked-out source, the gate still runs, still prints assertions, and still reports
# PASS/FAIL -- about a compiler that no longer exists. That is worse than an ordinary failure: a
# failure says "something is wrong", while a stale run produces plausible evidence for the wrong
# artifact.
#
# This happened four times in one session: `git checkout <branch>` without `lake build`, then
# reading the previous branch's behaviour as the current branch's. Once a shipped feature looked
# unimplemented; once three "parse errors" were about to be written up as a finding. Neither was
# real.
#
# `make` already protects the normal path -- the test targets depend on `build`. This protects the
# path used while iterating: `bash scripts/tests/check_foo.sh` run directly.
#
# MECHANISM: build, don't guess. An earlier version of this file compared mtimes, and measurement
# killed it: `lake build` completes successfully WITHOUT relinking the binary when the compiled
# output is unchanged, so a source file touched at 23:01 sits "newer" than a 22:53 binary that is
# in fact current. The guard fired permanently, and its own advice ("run lake build") could not
# clear it. A content fingerprint has the same shape of problem -- it needs a build-side hook to
# record what the binary was built FROM, which does not exist today.
#
# Delegating to lake sidesteps both: lake already knows whether the binary corresponds to the
# source, and a no-op build costs ~130ms (measured), which is affordable at the top of a gate.
