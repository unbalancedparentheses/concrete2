# CANONICAL TREE-STATE SNAPSHOTS — one producer, used by every start/end reconciliation.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Two long-running entry points reconcile the repository across their run:
# `check_gate_mutation_coverage.sh` (the mutation campaign) and `run_ci_gates_local.sh` (the gate
# runner). Each had grown its OWN implementation of "what does the tree look like", and the two
# disagreed — so a defect found and fixed in one silently survived in the other. Measured on
# 2026-08-21: the campaign's dirty-target test was repaired to see staged changes while the runner's
# was still blind to them, and the campaign's tree digests were moved to content while the runner's
# still hashed status text. Two producers of one fact is the defect class this repository keeps
# paying for, and a reconciliation that can be right in one caller and wrong in another is not a
# reconciliation.
#
# EVERY FUNCTION TAKES THE ROOT EXPLICITLY. The campaign runs from a snapshot under /tmp and must
# reconcile the REPOSITORY, not its own location, so deriving a root from `BASH_SOURCE` here would
# reintroduce the bug that produced 78 spurious "file no longer exists" failures.

# THE HASHER IS RESOLVED ONCE AND ITS ABSENCE IS FATAL. This assumed one of the two tools existed;
# with neither, every digest was empty output from a failed command, and two empty values compare
# equal — the same fail-open shape as a missing library.

# TRACKED CONTENT, not status text. `git status --porcelain` names files and status letters; editing
# an already-modified file leaves its porcelain line byte-identical, so a tree that moved under the

# as well as the worktree — a staged change is exactly as real as an unstaged one.

  # THE GIT FAILURE IS SIGNALLED, not digested. Piping failed output into a hash produces a real
  # digest of the empty string, which is indistinguishable from a clean tree and compares equal to
  # itself at both ends of the run.
  # `--binary`. Plain `git diff` renders a changed binary as "Binary files ... differ" plus an
  # `index <abbrev>..<abbrev>` line, so content only reaches the digest through a 7-character
  # abbreviated blob hash. (Measured: that line DOES change with content, so the reported
  # 'identical diff text' case did not reproduce — but relying on an abbreviated hash for
  # collision resistance is weaker than carrying the bytes, and this tree has tracked binary
  # fixtures.) `--binary` emits the actual delta.

  # VIA A TEMP FILE, NEVER A SHELL VARIABLE.
  #
  # MEASURED, 2026-08-21: capturing this diff into a variable and piping it returned an EMPTY digest,
  # with `sha256sum` and `cut` both failing "Argument list too long", at 144 KB of diff in this
  # repository. The empty digest and the E2BIG are observations; the CAUSE is not established —
  # `allexport` is off, and an unexported variable is not placed in `execve`'s argv or environment, so
  # the obvious explanation does not hold. I am not going to assert a mechanism I have not shown.
  #
  # What matters is the consequence and the remedy. Consequence: before the empty-value refusal
  # existed, an empty digest at both ends reconciled as an unchanged tree — a fail-open reached by
  # ordinary repository size rather than by any error. Remedy: the data never needs to be in a
  # variable, so it goes through a file and the question does not arise.
