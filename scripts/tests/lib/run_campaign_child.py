"""Launch the campaign child in its own session and report on its process group.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.

`killpg(pgid, 0)` establishes exactly one fact: no process remains in the campaign's ORIGINAL
process group. It does NOT establish that no campaign work remains anywhere. A descendant may call
setpgid(2), or start a session of its own, and outlive the group it was born into. Measured, not
assumed: a grandchild started with start_new_session leaves this check reporting an empty group
while it is still running, and a committed control asserts that non-detection so the limitation
cannot quietly become a claim.

That escape is OUT OF THE THREAT MODEL, deliberately and narrowly. The processes this campaign
starts are its own gates, `lake` and the compiler; none leave their process group, and the hazard
being defended against is an ACCIDENTAL survivor — a backgrounded build, an orphaned worker — not a
descendant hiding from its supervisor. Real containment needs a cgroup or a jail, neither portable
across the platforms this repository supports.

So the reported field is `process_group_state`, never `descendants_state`, and the supervisor refuses
with `campaign_group_not_empty`. Whoever reads the artifact learns which question was answered.

FOUR EARLIER ATTEMPTS, three of them shipped, all found by RUNNING a campaign rather than reading:
`pgrep -P $$` (one generation, and the child is already reaped); matching the repository path (also
matched the launcher); matching the workspace path (matched the supervisor itself, and any shell
whose command line merely CONTAINED the search string); and /proc ancestry (correct on Linux, absent
on macOS, where this repository has already taken an outage). Attempts 2-4 refused CLEAN runs, and a
check that always fires carries no more information than one that never does.

Designed using portable POSIX mechanisms — setsid via start_new_session, and killpg — so Linux and
macOS are INTENDED to agree; that equivalence is established by running the gate on both in CI, not
by this file asserting it.

Usage:
    run_campaign_child.py --report <path> --run-id <id> -- <command> [args...]

The report is written to <path> ATOMICALLY (temp file in the same directory, then rename) and only
after the child has exited, so a reader never observes a partial record. The child's stdout and
stderr are inherited untouched: they are the campaign transcript, and a launcher that captured them
would destroy the evidence it exists to protect.

Report fields, exactly once each, in this order:
    protocol_version=1          the contract this record is written against
    run_id=<str>                the run this status belongs to; a stale report cannot be reused
    child_rc=<int>              exit status; for a signalled child, 128+signal
    child_signalled=<0|1>       1 iff terminated by a signal — this is what distinguishes a child
                                that EXITED 143 from one KILLED by signal 15, which child_rc alone
                                cannot
    child_signal=<int>          the signal number, or 0
    process_group_state=<str>   empty | nonempty | permission_denied | error:<detail>
    pgid=<int>                  the group that was checked
