"""Select the gates a set of changed files can break.

Reads changed paths on stdin (one per line), writes `gate<TAB>reason` on stdout.

THE MAPPING IS READ OUT OF THE GATES, not hand-maintained. Gates name the files they
check — `check_byte_view.sh` contains `std/src/numeric.con` — so a curated list would
drift and this cannot. Gate-to-gate references come along for free and matter:
`check_mutation_anchors.sh` names `check_gate_mutation_coverage.sh`, so editing that
driver implicates the anchor gate.

IT IS NOT A PROOF OF COMPLETENESS. A gate can be broken by a change it never names — it
may compile a whole corpus, or assert a count derived from everything. Believing
otherwise would repeat the defect R-0483 removed from `ByteView`, where a check that
caught some substitutions read at the call site like one that caught all of them.
