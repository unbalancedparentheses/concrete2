# ByteView gate (ROADMAP Phase 5 #5a — the owned, stored, zero-copy idiom).
#
# ByteView is the value-model-clean substitute for a stored `&[u8]` field: an
# owned, Copy, reference-free [off, len) handle branded to a buffer length. This
# gate locks the three things that make it sound:
#
#   1. VALUE MODEL — ByteView stores no pointer/reference. It is `struct Copy`
#      with only u64 fields. (If a *ptr field ever appears, it is no longer a
#      reference-free owned value and the stored-view guarantee is broken.)
#   2. ACCESS GOES BACK THROUGH A BUFFER — access methods take `buf: &Bytes` and
#      return Option (None on any check failure); nothing returns a reference.
#   3. THE GUARDS FIRE — the example programs self-verify that wrong-buffer,
#      out-of-bounds, and overflow uses return None rather than silently passing.
#      They exit 0 only when every unsafe use is rejected.
#
# See docs/language/BYTE_VIEW.md.
