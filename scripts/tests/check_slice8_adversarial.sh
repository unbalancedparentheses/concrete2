# SLICE 8 — ADVERSARIAL CLOSURE (R-0004).
#
# Every other gate asks whether the evidence path works. This one assumes an attacker who has write
# access to the receipt store and wants a claim to read as kernel-replayed when it is not.
#
# THE STRUCTURE IS THE CONTROL. Each attack modifies exactly ONE record in a store of five genuine
# receipts, and every assertion checks BOTH halves:
#
#     the attacked record must not read as current   AND   the other four must still read current
#
# A consumer that rejected everything would satisfy the first half of every attack in this file and
# fail the second, so "deny all" cannot pass. A consumer that accepted everything fails the first.
# Neither degenerate answer survives.
#
# ATTACKS RUN THROUGH THE PRODUCTION CONSUMER — `--report proof-status --receipts` — not through a
# unit probe of the decoder. What matters is what the shipped status surface says when handed hostile
# bytes, because that is the thing a user reads.
#
# DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE: cache attacks. `ProofCache` does not exist, so a cold/warm/corrupt-cache
# test would pass vacuously today. It is a ProofCache graduation condition, not a Slice 8 exit
# criterion, and asserting it here would be a green light bought with an empty test.
