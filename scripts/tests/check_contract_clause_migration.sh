# Contract-clause migration gate (ROADMAP Phase 3 #10).
#
# The #[requires]/#[ensures]/#[invariant]/#[variant] clause statuses now live in
# the ONE ledger, not just the text contracts report:
#   • a malformed clause (unknown name / non-total construct) → a ledger
#     obligation of kind `invalid_contract_expression`, status `ineligible`;
#   • a clause calling a capability-requiring function → `impure_contract_call`,
#     status `ineligible`;
#   • a one-direction postcondition proof → `partial` (not a full proved_by_lean) —
#     the ledger now AGREES with the text report instead of overclaiming;
#   • a well-formed-but-unpreserved invariant is NOT a clause diagnostic (it stays
#     O2 `unproven`) — the migration must not manufacture a false diagnostic.
#
# Verified additive against the pre-#10 binary: only the new diagnostic rows
# appear, plus the single honest `proved_by_lean → partial` refinement.

# THE SURFACING MECHANISM CHANGED (2026-08-07). These two clauses used to compile and be
# carried as INELIGIBLE VC diagnostics; contract TYPE CHECKING now rejects them at check
# time, so the program never reaches VC generation and there is no VC to inspect.
#
# The legs are rewritten to the new mechanism rather than deleted, because the property
# they defend is unchanged and still worth defending: AN INVALID OR IMPURE CLAUSE MUST
# SURFACE, never be silently accepted. Rejection at check time satisfies that more strongly
# than an ineligible VC did — it is earlier, and it cannot be overlooked in a ledger.
#
# What IS lost is the ledger's record of these two cases; that trade is recorded below.

# there is nothing for the ledger to hold. The diagnostic is not lost — it is a hard error
# — but a consumer reading only the ledger will no longer see that this function HAD a
# malformed clause; it will see no entry for the function at all.
#
# Asserted in that direction: the ledger must REFUSE rather than report a clean function,
# which is the failure that would matter (a malformed contract reading as absent).
