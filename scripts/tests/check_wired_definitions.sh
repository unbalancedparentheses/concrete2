# WIRED DEFINITIONS — a ratchet on evidence-layer code that nothing consumes.
#
# Three separate pieces of this arc shipped DESIGNED, LANDED AND NEVER WIRED, and all three
# were found by accident rather than by any gate:
#
#   * `SubjectCompletenessV2.of` — the dependency axis, derived and never called;
#   * `SubjectQualificationV2`   — the assumption axis, zero consumers, and vacuous even if
#                                  it had had one, because assume() emitted a gap;
#   * `DependencyRoot`           — DepNode, typed edges, fail-closed errors, trust
#                                  propagation: a complete design with no producer.
#
# Each looked finished in review. The type was right, the doc comment was careful, and
# nothing called it. That is a specific failure mode worth an instrument: unused code in a
# normal codebase is dead weight, but here it means a FACT NOBODY IS CHECKING — the axis
# exists, so the subject looks like it has one, and no verdict ever consults it.
#
# WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A PROHIBITION. Same-file-only use is often legitimate: members of a
# mutual recursion are consumed by their own file's entry point (`exprCallees` by
# `bodyCallees`, `patternBytes` by `bodyBytesV2`), and a field type is consumed by
# pattern-matching on the tree that holds it. Those are not defects, and a gate that
# flagged them would be argued with until it was disabled. What is actionable is the
# DIRECTION: this number must not grow. New evidence-layer code arrives with a consumer, or
# it does not arrive.
