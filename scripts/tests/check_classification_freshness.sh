# === THE CHECKED-IN TABLE MUST NOT BE STALE (slice 6, blocker b) =============================
# `ClassificationTable.lean` is generated data the compiler trusts. Nothing else in R-0004 rests
# on a value nobody re-derives, and this must not be the exception: a stale table types edges
# from a theorem that has since been reproved, restated, or replaced by a different theorem of
# the same name — and every downstream check would pass, because the row is structurally valid.
#
# So the table is re-derived from the LIVE environment and compared. A stale table is a gate
# failure, not a silent wrong answer.
# THE NAME INVENTORY IS REDISCOVERED HERE, not taken from the generator. `classifications.lean`
# carries a GENERATED `sourceLinkedThms` list, so running it proves the table matches that list —
# not that the list matches the source. A new `#[proof_by]` annotation omitted from the list would
# leave the gate green while its theorem was never classified, which is exactly the gap that made
# `main.verify_message` proved-with-a-refusing-root.
#
# So: re-extract from source and compare against what the generator will actually ask about.
