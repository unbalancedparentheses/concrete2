# Hole-status consistency gate.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-07-31 three files said "H23 closed as a compile-time fact"  HOLE-STATUS-OK: quoting the wrong claim
# while docs/verification/KNOWN_HOLES.md said "H23 — OPEN, reproduced" and
# check_known_wrong_corpus.sh ASSERTED it still reproduces. Every gate was green. The
# contradiction survived because the claims live in different files and nothing compared
# them: check_docs_drift.sh verifies that referenced artifacts EXIST, not that statements
# agree, and a passing corpus gate says nothing about what the prose next to it claims.
#
# That is the same cross-document blindness recorded in 5a0c4e3e, and it had already been
# named as a class before it recurred. This gate closes it for the one kind of statement
# where being wrong is worst: whether a known soundness hole is open.
#
# THREE CHECKS, strongest first:
#   1. behaviour vs status — a hole with a live counterexample fixture must be OPEN
#   2. authority          — every hole heading carries exactly one parseable status
#   3. prose              — no other file asserts a status contradicting KNOWN_HOLES
#
# Check 1 is the one with teeth: it ties documented status to OBSERVED behaviour rather
# than to other prose. Check 3 is heuristic by nature (English), so it has an explicit
# escape hatch — see HOLE-STATUS-OK below — rather than pretending to be exact.

# The OTHER direction, which this gate lacked until 2026-08-03. Closing H23 left
# `Report.lean` still saying "Not H23 itself, which stays OPEN: nothing populates an   HOLE-STATUS-OK: quoting the wrong claim to correct it
# assumption set until R-0461" — an assertion that had become false, sitting in the exact
# module the fix landed in. Check 3 above only looked for open-claimed-closed, so it passed.
#
# This direction matters MORE than it sounds, because its failure mode is the inverse of the
# one this gate was built for: prose that understates what the compiler now guarantees
# teaches a reader to distrust a check that works, and the next person to touch that code
# reads the comment, not KNOWN_HOLES. Symmetry here is not tidiness — a status is only
# trustworthy if BOTH kinds of drift are loud.
#
# The exclusion list here is deliberately NARROWER than check 3's above: only genuine
# past-tense markers. `until`/`before` are excluded up there because "H24 is open until  HOLE-STATUS-OK: quoting the phrasing pattern, not asserting a status
# R-0464" is a legitimate future condition; down here "H23 stays OPEN ... until R-0461" is  HOLE-STATUS-OK: quoting the stale form to explain it
# the STALE form itself, and filtering on `until` is what hid Report.lean:2427 on this
# check's first run. Same word, opposite meaning, depending on the hole's status.
# BOTH WORD ORDERS. The first pattern catches "H23 is still open"; the second catches   HOLE-STATUS-OK
# "a live, reproduced instance: H23" — status word FIRST, hole id second. The second order  HOLE-STATUS-OK
# was missing until 2026-08-04 and two stale claims were sitting in it: VC_BRIDGE_REGISTER.md
# still called H23 "a live, reproduced instance" and declared every row's Assumes clause
# "currently false in the presence of loop invariants", and ROADMAP.md still called H24 "the
# live problem". Both had been false for a day, in the two documents most likely to be read
# as authoritative about what is broken.
#
# The lesson generalises past this gate: a prose check written against one phrasing tests
# that phrasing, not the claim. Widen on evidence, which is what this is.
#
# But widen CAREFULLY. The first version of the reverse pattern used bare `live|open`, and
# both words are heavily overloaded in this repo: "live at the loop boundary" is liveness
# analysis, and "the last open half of H1" describes a decision's scope. It produced four
# false positives across CHANGELOG.md and CALLABLE_VALUES_AND_CAPABILITIES.md. A gate whose
# failures are usually noise gets ignored, which costs more than the drift it catches — so
# the reverse direction matches only words that assert a hole is CURRENTLY defective
# (`reproduced`, `unfixed`, `live problem/instance/defect/counterexample`) and drops bare
# `open` entirely. Both stale claims that motivated this are still caught.  HOLE-STATUS-OK
