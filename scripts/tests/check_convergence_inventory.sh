#    not equality, and the derived view turned out to be strictly richer. It records an
#    assignment TARGET as a use of a binder and a match pattern's FIELD identity, neither
#    of which the accumulator ever saw. Two gates that pinned the old, lossy numbers had to
#    be updated to assert the recovered identities (check_type_identity 7 -> 10,
#    check_binder_refs 4 -> 5).

# --- R-0004: open language decision --------------------------------------------------

#
#    The producer was believed to REFUSE struct literals until this was decided —
#    `EvidenceBuild.evStructLitPending` existed and its docstring said so. It was never
#    called. The producer emits a real `structLit` ordered by the DECLARATION list, so the
#    undecided order has been in the shadow bytes the whole time: the outcome the refusal
#    was written to prevent, guarded by a comment instead of by behaviour.
#
#    The bytes are accurate to today's semantics and stay. What must not happen is the
#    order becoming AUTHORITATIVE while undecided, so the close condition is ratification
#    before the fingerprint migration — asserted below rather than trusted to prose.
# 5-CLOSED (2026-08-08). The close condition this entry stated was RATIFICATION before the
#    fingerprint migration, and that is what happened: the matrix records "struct-literal
#    initializers evaluate in SOURCE order". The entry was never converted when its own condition
