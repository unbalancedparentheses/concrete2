# rows, every existing probe passes, and the two missing definitions are simply not described.
#
# So the join is asserted here, per table, and every gap must be a NAMED exclusion. This is also what

#
#   elfFns / proof_pressure / validate_header — the known misattachment. `proof_pressure` carries
#   `#[proof_by(Examples.ElfHeader.Proofs.validate_header_correct)]`, so the manifest offers the row,
#   but its `validate_header` calls `check_nonce` and `elfFns` does not hold it: this table's model
#   does not model that implementation. Attestation BINDS and does not check faithfulness, so
#   selecting the reference would make the table describe a function it does not describe, and
#   nothing downstream would catch it.
#
#   ctTagFns / evidence_classes/stale_proof / ct_compare — a DRIFTED implementation. Same linked
#   theorem, but the body starts `diff` at 1 instead of 0, and the compiler says so itself:
#   `--report proof-status` reports SPEC DRIFT, "the theorem is about a different function than the
#   source". Attesting it would bind the model to an implementation it does not model, and nothing
#   would catch it — `scopedEntryEvidence` recomputes the digest of the MODEL's body, never the
#   implementation's. The manifest still offers the row (see the drift-classifier check below).
# The `elfFns` / `proof_pressure` / `validate_header` exclusion was REMOVED on 2026-08-15 — not
# because the rule relaxed, but because the fixture was repaired: its misattached `#[proof_by]` is
# gone, so the manifest no longer offers the row and an exclusion for it would be stale. This is the

# second, weaker producer of a fact the compiler already computes, and it has a live miss:
# `examples/evidence_classes/stale_proof` declares "the body has DRIFTED", does not match the
# pattern, and its row IS offered for attestation. Attesting it would bind a model to an
# implementation it does not model — and no downstream check would catch that, because
# `scopedEntryEvidence` recomputes the digest of the MODEL's body, never the implementation's.
#
# So the verdict is re-derived from the compiler here: any manifest row whose fixture reports SPEC
# DRIFT must be a DECLARED exclusion at its table site. This does not repair the manifest's
# classifier — that is a package-1 decision — it stops the conversion path from consuming its miss.
