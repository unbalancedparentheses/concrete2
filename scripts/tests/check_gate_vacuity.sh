# Vacuity ratchet: a gate that guards against gates which cannot fail.
#
# `all(P(x) for x in xs)` is TRUE when `xs` is empty. So is "the forbidden string does not appear
# in this output" when there is no output. Both read as a pass, and neither has checked anything.
# The general hazard:
#
#     every universal property holds over the empty collection
#
# This is not theoretical here. Promoting an impure-call defect from a report line to a check
# error made a positive control in check_contract_negatives.sh pass BECAUSE the fixture was
# rejected wholesale: its report was empty, so "no `impure call` in the cn.good block" was true
# for want of a cn.good block. The gate was green and proved nothing. See H27.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES, and what it deliberately does not. It counts two greppable shapes and fails if
# the count RISES above a recorded baseline. It does not attempt to prove any individual
# assertion vacuous — that needs the runtime collection, not the source text. A ratchet stops the
# population growing while the existing ones are fixed; calling it a proof of non-vacuity would
# be the same overclaiming this file exists to catch.

# --- shape 3: unintended command substitution inside diagnostic strings -----------------------
# A gate can run a FAILING SHELL COMMAND and still report PASS. `check_transform_register.sh`
# contained
#     echo "=== ... (no gratuitous `partial`) ==="
# whose backticks executed `partial` as a command. The run printed "partial: command not found"
# and still ended TRANSFORM-REGISTER: PASS=80 FAIL=0, because these scripts do not use `set -e`
# and an unintended failure is counted by nothing.
#
# The vacuity ratchet above cannot see this class: the assertions genuinely passed. What was
# unclean was the HARNESS, and a harness that executes stray commands can also silently swallow
# the output an assertion depends on. Backticks inside a double-quoted string are the greppable
# form; the escaped variant (\`) is correct and common, so only unescaped ones count.
# WIDENED 2026-08-08, because the narrow version MISSED a live instance. It scanned `echo "…"`
# only, and the defect arrived as `expect_no_compile "…"` — the ratchet guarded one syntactic
# form rather than the hazard, which is the shape of mistake it exists to catch.
#
# Now: an unescaped backtick inside ANY double-quoted shell string. Most existing hits are on
# FAILURE paths (`no "… \`foo\` …"`), so they fire only when an assertion already failed —
# latent rather than harmless, since they corrupt output exactly when it matters most. They are
# ratcheted rather than fixed in bulk: the count may fall, never rise.
# BASELINE TIGHTENED 17 -> 6 on 2026-08-13, when comment lines stopped being counted. Eleven of the
# seventeen were PROSE, which means this ratchet had eleven slots of slack: a real
# backtick-in-a-string bug could have been introduced without moving the number. An inflated
# baseline is a ratchet that has already been loosened.

# COMMENT LINES ARE SKIPPED. This counter matched any line with a backtick pair inside double
# quotes, including SHELL COMMENTS — so prose describing a Lean identifier tripped it. On 2026-08-13
# it failed a new gate purely for the sentence in its header explaining what the gate is for. A
# comment cannot run a command, so counting it is a false positive, and the fix a false positive
# invites is rewriting documentation to appease a grep. This is the third guard in this suite to hit
# exactly this (see lib/code_refs.sh); the shape is: text-matching guards must know what code is.
#
# Self-tested below, because narrowing what a counter reads is only safe if it still counts.
