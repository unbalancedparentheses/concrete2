# EVIDENCE REPRODUCIBILITY (R-0004 package 3).
#
# Every identity R-0004 mints is supposed to be a property of the PROGRAM, not of where the program
# happens to sit. `PackageIdentity.of?` refuses a component that looks location-dependent, which
# establishes the rule at the type level and says nothing about whether the pipeline OBEYS it: a path
# could still reach an identity through a digest, a source map, or a report that composes one.
#
# So this gate compiles the same program from a different absolute path and requires the evidence to
# be identical — subject identities, dependency roots, correspondence, and the attestation join.
#
# WITH A NEGATIVE CONTROL, because "two runs agree" is exactly what a check comparing constants would
# also report. A copy whose CONTENT differs by one character must produce different identities, or
# the comparison above is measuring nothing.
