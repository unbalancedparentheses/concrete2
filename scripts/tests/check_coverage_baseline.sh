# THE ELIGIBILITY-DENOMINATED COVERAGE BASELINE (R-0004 package 3).
#
# "How much of this corpus is proved?" has been answerable only by reading a report and adding up, and
# a number reached that way drifts the moment a status is added — which has already happened twice in
# this project, both times leaving a totals row that did not total.
#
# So the baseline is MEASURED here, over an explicit denominator, with every disposition named. The
# point is not the ratio; it is that the ratio has a denominator nobody has to reconstruct, and that
# a claim moving between dispositions is visible rather than absorbed.
#
# EXACT VALUES, NOT RATCHETS. A rising `proved` count is not automatically good: it can mean a claim
# stopped being checked. Every number is pinned and a change must be explained.
