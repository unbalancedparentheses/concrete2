# Constructor-coverage gate (pipeline refactor #3).
#
# The compiler has many independent recursive walkers (checker, elaborator,
# monomorphizer, core-checker, proof extraction, interpreter, lowering,
# formatter). Every new AST/Core expression constructor risks ONE of those
# walkers silently not handling it — a wildcard `| _ =>` swallows it, and the
# miss only surfaces as a runtime wrong-answer much later. This is the
# compiler-pipeline analogue of the feature-interaction checklist.
#
# This gate makes "every constructor is handled by every walker that must handle
# it" a mechanically-checked invariant:
#
#   - the surface `Expr` constructors are extracted from Frontend/AST.lean and
#     each must appear explicitly (`.ctor`) in every FRONTEND pass;
#   - the core `CExpr` constructors are extracted from Elab/Core.lean and each
#     must appear explicitly in every CORE pass.
#
# The constructor lists are read from the source, not hard-coded, so adding a
# constructor and forgetting to teach a walker about it FAILS this gate. The
# four surface-only forms (methodCall / staticMethodCall / arrowAccess / paren)
# are desugared in Resolve/Elab and correctly do not exist as CExpr — that is
# why the two matrices are checked against different constructor lists.
#
# A pass "handles" a constructor iff the token `.<ctor>` occurs in its file.
# Today every cell is covered; this gate locks that in. It greps source only
# (no compiler build required) and lives in the grammar CI job.

# OBLIGATION DISCOVERY. Enrolled 2026-08-06.
#
# HONEST LIMIT, measured rather than assumed: `covers` is FILE-granular, so this catches "no
# walker anywhere handles constructor X" and NOT "walker #2 forgot X while walker #3 still has
# it". Verified by mutation -- deleting the `.allocCall` arm from `collectDivisorsE` does not
# fail this gate, because three sibling walkers still mention `.allocCall`.
#
# So it guards the extreme case, not the case that actually occurred. Recording that because a
# gate described as preventing a bug class, which only prevents its worst version, is how a green
# number starts meaning less than it appears to. Per-walker coverage needs a checker that parses
# each `def` separately -- worth doing, and not what this is.
#
# It should have been enrolled from the start regardless: the walkers
# that decide whether a runtime-safety obligation is EMITTED live here, and a constructor no
# walker handles is an obligation that is never generated -- no failed proof, no `unproven`
# marker, just a green report. Seven such defects were found by hand this year (`(a)[i]`,
# `b.data[i]`, unannotated array sizes, nested declarations, shadowed bindings); every one was a
# case some walker did not cover. This gate is the mechanical version of that search.
# Leaves are EXCLUDED, and the distinction is the whole point. A `boolLit`/`strLit`/`fnRef`
# contains no subexpression, so a catch-all returning `[]` is CORRECT for it -- demanding an
# explicit arm would be noise. What must never be missed is a COMPOUND constructor: one holding a
# sub-expression the walker has to recurse into, because forgetting one silently loses every
# obligation underneath it.
