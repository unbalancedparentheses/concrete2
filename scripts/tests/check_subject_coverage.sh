# R-0004: corpus-wide inventory of subject-facts coverage, grouped by cause.
#
# A subject digest is only produced when a declaration's contracts are fully
# encodable. An UNCOVERED declaration is fail-closed and correct, but it also
# cannot participate in V2 freshness: replay can never establish a V2 claim for
# it. So before freshness is activated authoritatively, the uncovered set must be
# a known, named inventory rather than a number nobody has looked at.
#
# This gate pins that inventory. It fails when coverage REGRESSES (a new uncovered
# declaration appears) and equally when it silently IMPROVES, because a drop must
# come with a deliberate update naming which cause was closed.

# Measured 2026-08-03 over examples/; covered count updated when the ghost cause closed. The proof corpus, not the whole
# test tree: tests/programs/ holds deliberate uncovered probes whose whole purpose
# is to be uncovered, and mixing them in would hide a real regression in the noise.
EXPECT_COVERED=419
# 1 -> 0 on 2026-08-07: the last uncovered case (invalid_contract_expression) stopped
# being one when contract type-checking landed and rejected it before subject
# construction. See the cause notes below. ZERO is now the assertion — every declaration
# the corpus reaches produces a covered subject — which is a stronger claim than the count
# it replaces, and it fails on any RISE.
EXPECT_UNCOVERED=0

# The uncovered set, by cause. Both causes are OPEN work, tracked here because a
# bare count would not say what closing them requires.
#
#   const  — CLOSED. A module constant now encodes as `k:<ConstId>=<initializer>`:
#            semantic identity so it cannot be confused with a same-spelled
#            function, AND its value so that changing `const LIMIT = 16` to `= 32`
#            invalidates dependent subjects. LOCAL constants only — ConstSummary
#            carries neither an initializer nor a defining module, so an IMPORTED
#            constant has neither half and still fails closed.
#   ghost  — CLOSED. Ghost bindings now form their own binder frame, collected
#            from the AST in source order and rendered `h:<i>`, so a contract may
#            name them without going uncovered. Both ghost programs are covered as
#            of this change; the cause is retained here as a record of what the
#            count used to include.
#   invalid — a deliberate negative example; uncovered WAS the correct verdict.
#
#             CAUSE CLOSED 2026-08-07 by the spike/multi-kernel-theories merge. Contracts
#             are now TYPE-CHECKED, so `invalid_contract_expression` is rejected during
#             check ("contract on 'bad': unknown identifier 'nonexistent'") and never
#             becomes a subject at all. A program that does not reach subject construction
#             cannot be uncovered; the fixture still earns its keep as a contract negative,
#             it just stopped being a COVERAGE case.
#
#             This gate failed on the DROP rather than passing quietly, which is the whole
#             point of asserting an exact count: a cause closing has to be recorded
#             deliberately, or the inventory drifts from why the number is what it is.
