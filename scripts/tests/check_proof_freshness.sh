# R-0004 slice 1 — executable witnesses for the proof-freshness defect class.
#
# Bugs 058, 059, 060 and 062 had numbered documents with replay transcripts, but
# a transcript in prose is not a reproducer: it cannot fail. This gate makes each
# one executable, so the defect is observable on every run and the eventual fix
# is observable too.
#
# It is a TRIPWIRE, and that needs saying plainly. Several legs below assert the
# CURRENT, WRONG verdict — a `proved` that should not be `proved`. They pass
# today because the bug is present. When a later slice fixes it, those legs FAIL,
# and that failure is the signal to move the leg from "gap open" to "gap closed",
# not a regression. This is the same shape as the `boundary.lean` leg in
# check_operational_vc_auto_discharge.sh.
#
# Every gap leg is paired with a CONTROL: a nearby edit that IS detected. Without
# the control, "reports proved" could just mean the harness never re-read the
# file, and the gate would be measuring nothing.
#
# Fixture policy: these drive the real `examples/loop_invariant` and
# `examples/crypto_verify` projects, copied to a temp dir and edited there. Real
# proof links with real stored fingerprints are the point — a synthetic fixture
# with a hand-written fingerprint would prove only that string comparison works.
