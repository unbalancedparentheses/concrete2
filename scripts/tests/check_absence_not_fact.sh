# The rule and its evidence are in docs/project/ABSENCE_IS_NOT_A_FACT.md. Seven instances
# were found across unrelated subsystems written at different times, six of them in one
# session, which is why this is gated rather than left as review discipline: the pattern
# does not correlate with author or subsystem, it correlates with a total function being
# asked a question it cannot answer and having a value available that reads as an answer.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE CAN AND CANNOT DO. It cannot decide in general whether a `none` branch
# means "genuinely absent" (legitimate — `diagsMatch` with no substring matches
# everything) or "could not determine" (the defect). A grep for `| none =>` returns 63
# hits here and nearly all are correct, and a gate that is mostly noise gets ignored,
# which would make it another thing that looks like a check and is not.
#
# So it pins the HIGH-RISK sites specifically: the two capability-inference fallbacks that
# were the defect, and the trusted-extern site that is its root. Each assertion names what
# would have to be true for it to fail.
