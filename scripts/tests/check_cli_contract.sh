#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Golden CLI behavior matrix (ROADMAP Phase 4 #15).
#
# Pins the externally-observable contract of each PUBLIC command: exit code,
# which stream carries output (stdout vs stderr), --json well-formedness where
# supported, missing-project behavior, unknown-command / malformed-input behavior,
# and output-artifact location. This is a contract gate, not a refactor: it asserts
# what the commands already promise so future changes cannot silently break them.
#
# First slice (existing commands only): build, run, test, check, prove, --report,
# --version, no-args, unknown command, missing Concrete.toml, malformed input.
# Future commands (inspect, fmt, doc, clean) are listed as NOT-YET so the matrix
# makes their absence explicit rather than inventing them.

# REPORT EXIT-STATUS MATRIX.
#
# Three handlers — attestation-join, generated-implementations, impl-manifest — printed their report
# and then FELL THROUGH to the "Unknown report type" branch, exiting 1 with a diagnostic naming the
# report the caller had just received. Callers checking status saw failure on correct output, and a
# test gate was consuming exactly that. Nothing here asserted a report's exit code, so the defect was
# invisible; the whole point of this matrix is that a report's status is part of its contract.
#
# Success is asserted as COMPLETE output, not merely non-empty: a handler that printed a header and
# died would otherwise still look correct.
