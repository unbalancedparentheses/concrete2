# R-0004: scoped lexical binder frames, the ProofBodyCanonicalV2 prerequisite.
#
# The property under test is narrow and load-bearing: a binder's identity must be a
# POSITION, that position must be stable against unrelated scope changes, and an
# unresolved name must REFUSE rather than get invented. Raw env.vars indices satisfy
# none of the three, which is why this exists.
