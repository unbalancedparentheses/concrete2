# VC-generator differential gate.
#
# The calculus (`Concrete/Report/VCGen.lean`) is shadow-only: nothing consumes it. Its whole value
# is that it can be diffed against the eight hand-written walkers and leaves, which are the oracle
# now that their nine defects are fixed and gated. Without this gate that diff is a report someone
# has to remember to run, and a silent regression in either implementation goes unnoticed until
# the switchover — the worst possible time to discover it.
#
# WHY IT COUNTS VOLUME, NOT JUST AGREEMENT: the first corpus sweep reported agreement across 99
# files while comparing 0 obligations against 0. Both sides found nothing, and "agree" was
# vacuous. Three separate checks passed over an empty set on the day this was written, so a
# differential that cannot distinguish "they match" from "neither ran" is not evidence.
