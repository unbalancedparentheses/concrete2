# WHICH GATES CAN THIS DIFF BREAK?
#
# CI runs 204 `check_*.sh` gates. Nothing mapped a change to the gates it could break, so
# the practical procedure was "know which ones to run", and that procedure fails exactly
# when a change reaches further than its author expected. R-0483 is the worked example: a
# stdlib rewrite broke, in four separate CI rounds, the stdlib surface manifest, the
# shadow-body extraction coupling, six mutation-family anchors, and the ByteView gate.
# Each was a DIFFERENT derived artifact of one change, and each round fixed only what CI
# had just named.
#
# The mutation-anchor one is why this exists rather than being a convenience. Renaming a
# symbol left six anchors pointing at text that no longer occurred, and an anchor that
# does not match does not fail loudly — the mutation becomes inert, applies nothing, and
# the gate it exists to prove silently stops proving it while the campaign still counts
# the family. A gate that quietly stops testing is worse than a gate that goes red.
#
# HOW THE MAPPING IS DERIVED. Gates name the files they check — `check_byte_view.sh`
# contains `std/src/numeric.con`, `check_stdlib_manifest.sh` contains `std/src/`. So the
# map is read out of the gates themselves rather than hand-maintained, which means it
# cannot drift out of date the way a curated list would. Gate-to-gate references are
# included for free and matter: `check_mutation_anchors.sh` names
# `check_gate_mutation_coverage.sh`, so editing the driver implicates the anchor gate.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a proof of completeness, and treating it as one would
# repeat the mistake R-0483 just removed from `ByteView` — a check that catches some
# cases reads at the call site like one that catches all of them. A gate can be broken by
# a change it never names: it may compile a whole corpus, or assert a count derived from
# everything. The ALWAYS set below covers the derived-artifact gates for that reason, and
# the output says plainly what the mapping does and does not establish. When in doubt,
# run the job.
