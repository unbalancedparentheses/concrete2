# Red-team gate for the ObligationCore ledger (Phase 3 hardening).
#
# Every function in examples/contract_negatives/obligation_redteam is an attack:
# a construct that must NEVER read as proved, must NOT launder trust into kernel
# evidence, must NOT drift between surfaces, and must be caught by release policy.
# This gate tries to break the ledger and asserts it refuses:
#   1. NO FALSE GREEN — unsafe overflow / OOB index / div-by-zero / a
#      laundering assert / a vacuous postcondition are never `proved`.
#   2. NO DRIFT — --report vcs and the ledger agree on every id+status.
#   3. FIREWALL — even a LYING external solver cannot turn a kernel-unproved VC
#      into kernel evidence, nor a kernel-owned VC into solver evidence.
#   4. POLICY catches every escape (E0613 vacuous, E0614 assume, E0615 solver).
