# std IS A PACKAGE AND IS NOW COMPILED AS ONE. This gate used to copy `std/src` to a temp directory
# and compile the loose tree, because `loadProject` refused a package whose entry is `src/lib.con`.
# That workaround DESTROYED the package identity, which is the thing scoped evidence depends on — so
# after the Package 2 authority transition every std subject carried a source name only and its
# correspondence and dependency root refused. The 11-proved figure this gate asserted was obtainable
# only by bypassing scoped evidence.
#
# The underlying bug (a package injected as its own dependency) was fixed 2026-08-16, so the copy is
# gone and std is compiled in place.

#
# Nine of the eleven report `needs_recheck`, and the reported reason CHANGED at the V2 activation
# without the underlying situation improving. They used to report `dependency closure unjustified`:
# their theorems rest on `pureCoreFns`, which carries no manifest row, describes no definitions and
# justifies nothing. That is still true. It is simply no longer what gets reported, because the
# deriver settles comparability BEFORE justification and these nine are no longer comparable at all.
#
# Their v2 subject is INCOMPLETE, so no digest is minted and the stored v1 value has nothing to be
# measured against. Verified, not assumed: `--report subject-facts` gives
# `numeric_Port_try_new` `shadow bodyV2: REFUSED (1 gap(s): intrinsic cast: target TypeId not
# minted here)` and `subject digest: INCOMPLETE (no digest minted)`. The structural body producer
# does not yet cover intrinsic casts, and four of the nine are additionally generic (`/1`, `/2`,
# `/3`). That is a REMAINING GAP IN THE V2 PRODUCER, recorded here rather than papered over.
#
# Both dispositions are non-proved, so nothing false is claimed either way — but the newer one is
# LESS informative: `needs_recheck` reads as "re-record the fingerprint", and re-recording would not
# help, because the closure would still be unjustified underneath. Asserting these nine as `proved`
# would require re-adopting the de-packaged compilation that made the refusal invisible.
#
# The two base64 links DO prove, and they are the live positive control: without them "nine are
# unjustified" would also be satisfied by std carrying no evidence at all.

# RE-PINNED 2026-08-18, and the new form is stronger than the one it replaces. These nine used to be
# absent from the replay set, and the legs asserted that absence. `replayTargetsOf` was widened in
# 2c921d6d to include `correspondenceUnjustified` and `needsRecheck`, deliberately: replay answers
# "does this theorem typecheck", which is independent of whether a claim's dependencies are current
# or its closure is justified — those are facts about OTHER declarations. Excluding them stranded
# links in the V1->V2 migration with `not_replayed`, unable to ask about the very claims the
# migration exists to clear.
#
# So asserting "not replayed" now asserts a policy that was intentionally abandoned. What must hold
# instead is the boundary that actually matters, and it is the one this whole effort is about:
# KERNEL ACCEPTANCE MUST NOT BECOME `proved`. The kernel says a theorem typechecks; it says nothing
# about whether this function's closure is justified or its stored subject is comparable. Each leg
# below therefore asserts BOTH halves — the theorem verifies, AND the claim is still not proved —
# which is a real conjunction that a regression in either direction breaks. The previous form could
# be satisfied by the replay set going empty for any reason at all.

# reports `needs_recheck` no matter what the body does, and editing the body changes NOTHING in the
# report. Asserting "a body edit is flagged stale" there could never pass again, and — worse — an
# incomparable subject makes any freshness control run against it permanently vacuous.
#
# So the control runs on a subject the machinery can actually see. `base64_char_of` has a real v2
# subject and a migrated v2 stored value, and the edit below moves it, which is what proves the
