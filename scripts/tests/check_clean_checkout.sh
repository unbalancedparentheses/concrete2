# CLEAN-CHECKOUT REPRODUCIBILITY AND COMPILER PROVENANCE (R-0004 package 3).
#
# `check_evidence_reproducibility.sh` establishes PATH independence: the same program at a different
# absolute path yields identical evidence. That is necessary and it is not sufficient. Two runs can
# be equally path-independent and still disagree about WHICH COMPILER produced them, or agree for the
# wrong reason because both read the same working tree.
#
# This gate covers what path independence does not:
#
#   * a genuinely CLEAN CHECKOUT — `git clone` into a fresh directory, no build artifacts, no
#     untracked files — produces the same evidence as the working tree;
#   * invocation from the REPOSITORY ROOT and from the PROJECT ROOT agree;
#   * the compiler identity a receipt binds is the CONTENT OF THE EXECUTABLE THAT RAN, not the
#     repository's state at report time.
#
# THE COMPILER-IDENTITY LEG IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. Two earlier identities were wrong in both
# directions: `-dirty` from `git status` (any untracked file invalidated every receipt, and a binary
# built dirty then cleaned reported clean), and `git rev-parse HEAD` (a binary built from commit A
# claims B once the checkout moves, and a binary built from uncommitted sources claims whatever is
# checked out). Digesting the executable answers all three of the cases that matter:
#
#   built from A while the checkout points at B  -> identity unchanged; it describes the binary
#   built from uncommitted sources               -> content no committed build has -> distinct
#   substituted executable at the same commit    -> different content -> different identity

# THE EXECUTABLE-DIGEST SECTION IS GONE, and its absence is the honest position rather than an
# omission. It asserted that the reported identity equals `sha256(the running binary)` and that a
# byte-appended copy therefore digests differently — true of the `exe:` identity that used to be
# reported, and false of the design that replaced it.
#
# The identity is now computed AT BUILD TIME over the compiler's own sources, because the executable
# digest was not portable: neither `/proc/self/exe` nor GNU `sha256sum` exists on macOS, and receipt
# issuance simply refused there. That trade is recorded in scripts/gen/build_identity.sh, and it has
# a KNOWN LIMIT stated in the same place — a binary patched after build keeps the constant its
# sources produced. Re-asserting the old property here would contradict the documented limitation
# and would fail permanently, which is exactly what it did: these lines have not run since the
# identity changed, because a stray `exit 1` sat in front of them.
#
# What survives of the intent lives where it can be checked: check_build_identity_freshness.sh
# asserts the value is content-derived, 128-bit, portable, and moves with its sources, and the leg
# above asserts one binary reports one identity from two checkouts. Binding the shipped BYTES needs
# a portable streaming executable digest or a signed build manifest, which is tracked as
# post-R-0004 provenance work and is not claimed today.

# THE CHECKOUT-MOVES CASE. Receipts minted now must survive the repository moving underneath them,

# state only if the tree is dirty, so this uses an untracked file — the exact noise that used to

# made issuance refuse there outright.
#
# The build identity is a constant compiled INTO the binary. There is no locating step that can fail
# and no digest that can be unreadable at run time, so the branch those names guarded does not exist
# to be reachable. Keeping the assertion would test a design decision that was reversed.
#
# The property it protected — that an "unknown" identity is never recorded, since one "unknown"
# compares equal to any other — is now held by construction plus a behavioural control:
# check_build_identity_freshness.sh asserts the value is present, 32 hex characters, and equal to a
# fresh derivation from the sources. That is a stronger guarantee than a refusal path, because there
# is nothing left to refuse.
#
# It was also a grep over source text, which this gate's own policy note a few sections up forbids
