# THE DIFF-TO-GATE MAPPING, TESTED AGAINST A DIFF WHOSE ANSWER IS ALREADY KNOWN.
#
# `gates_for_diff.sh` selects the gates a change can break. A mapping nothing tests is a
# mapping that quietly stops mapping — the same failure as an inert mutation anchor, and
# worse here, because the thing that stops working is the thing you consult INSTEAD of
# running everything.
#
# The fixture is the R-0483 stdlib repair, chosen because its answer was established the
# expensive way: four CI rounds, each surfacing one more derived artifact of one change.
# The stdlib surface manifest went stale; excluding higher-order functions collided with
# shadow-body extraction; renaming symbols left six mutation anchors INERT; and the
# ByteView gate still asserted the design the repair removed. Every one of those is a
# gate the mapping must name for that diff, and the list is not a guess.
#
# A selector that returned every gate would pass all of that and be useless, so precision
# is asserted too: the answer must be a small fraction of the suite, and an unrelated
# change must not drag in the stdlib surface.
