# PRODUCTION RECEIPT ISSUANCE (R-0004 package 3).
#
# Until 2026-08-16 `ProofEvidenceReceipt` was, honestly described, a well-tested helper type: the
# envelope was closed, the minting authority was closed, and NOTHING IN THE PIPELINE EVER MINTED ONE.
# `--report receipts` is the path from "the kernel accepted this" to a receipt, and this gate holds
# it to the two things that make issuance evidence rather than output:
#
#   * IT DERIVES NOTHING ITSELF. Each of the four inputs — the kernel's acceptance, the theorem's
#     classification, the subject digest, the dependency root — comes from the single producer that
#     already answers that question elsewhere, and each refuses on its own terms.
#   * EVERY WITHHOLDING NAMES ITS CAUSE. "No receipt" and "receipt withheld because X" are different
#     facts, and only the second is actionable.
#
# THE DRIFT FIXTURE IS THE LOAD-BEARING CONTROL, because issuance got this wrong on the day it
# landed: it minted four receipts for `elf_header_drifted`, two of them for `stale` claims whose
# bodies had changed since their proofs were linked. The token says the kernel accepted a THEOREM; it
# says nothing about whether that theorem still proves THIS body.
