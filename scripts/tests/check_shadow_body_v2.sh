# `--report subject-facts` now prints two shadow lines. They answer different questions and
# the distinction is the whole reason both exist:
#
#   shadow identityUses  digests the flat list of identity REFERENCES. Measured on the
#                        corpus, `p + 1`, `p * 2` and `p - 9` hash identically there — it is
#                        a reference inventory, not a body representation.
#   shadow bodyV2        digests the STRUCTURAL body, where those three differ.
#
# Both are shadow. The authoritative subject digest stays V1-frozen, and this gate asserts
# that it stays that way: structural bytes reaching a STATUS is the thing that must not
# happen by accident.

# --- containment: the structural bytes must not reach anything authoritative -----------
# Exactly two references are expected: the definition, and the report line. A third is not
# automatically wrong, but it must be looked at, which is why this asserts the set rather
# than a count.
# OWNER SET UPDATED 2026-08-09: ProofCore joins it, because `proofSubjectDigestV2` now binds the
# structural body instead of the legacy Core-statement hash. That is the point of slice 5 — the
# subject the shadow comparison digests must be the real one — and it is why a file-list proxy
# alone is no longer the right guard.
#
# The property this section actually protects is one step further in: no STATUS may depend on
# structural bytes before the step-7 migration. The owner list is kept as a cheap tripwire (a
# FOURTH owner still needs looking at), and the property is asserted directly below it, because
# a proxy that has to be widened every time the design advances stops meaning anything.
# The tripwire measures CODE references, not prose. It used to `grep -rln`, which counts any
# mention -- and on 2026-08-11 that fired on a DOC COMMENT in `DependencyEdge` explaining where the
# manifest's implementation digest comes from. Documenting the containment boundary is not crossing
# it, and a guard that cannot tell the difference trains you to widen its allowlist for prose,
# which is exactly how an allowlist stops meaning anything.
#
# So: strip Lean comments (`/- ... -/` blocks, including `/-- ... -/`, and `--` to end of line),
# THEN look for the identifier. Narrowing what the tripwire reads is only safe if it still catches a
# real reference, so `code_refs` is self-tested below on a synthetic tree before it is trusted here.
