# R-0004 step 5 — migrating the nine hand-written FnTables, with DUAL COMPARISON.
#
# A hand-written table becomes evidence-bearing by gaining `entries`. That is only
# sound if its hand-written spec is genuinely the compiler's extraction — otherwise
# the migration mints a root over a body the program does not have, and every proof
# resting on it describes something else.
#
# So each migrated table is compared against a FRESH GENERATION from its example:
#   * the identity the compiler mints, field for field;
#   * the body, via `sourceBodyDigestV1` over `pexprCanonical` — the committed
#     table's spec must hash to what the compiler computes from source;
#   * declared keys resolve, and an UNDECLARED key still resolves to none (control,
#     so "resolves" cannot be an artifact of a total function);
#   * the key -> identity mapping is the one evaluation uses (`dispatchResolves`);
#   * the table is evidence-bearing and has a root;
#   * kernel replay of that example's proofs still succeeds.
#
# The inventory leg at the end is the one that makes this a migration rather than a
# collection of migrations: it counts tables that are STILL legacy, so finishing is
# a measurable state and a forgotten table cannot pass as done.
