# R-0004 V2 probe, step 1 — V1 body fingerprints are FROZEN.
#
# V2 is built ALONGSIDE V1, never by modifying it: the stored
# `#[proof_fingerprint]` corpus was computed under V1, so a change to
# `bodyFingerprint` reports the corpus stale and invites the backfill that is
# forbidden until kernel replay issues a trustworthy receipt. "V1 untouched"
# must therefore be CHECKED, not intended.
#
# Two DIFFERENT populations, counted separately because they answer different
# questions and conflating them was a real error here:
#   * 77 EXTRACTED functions across eight examples — what the golden hashes;
#   * 44 STORED #[proof_fingerprint] values — the migration input.
