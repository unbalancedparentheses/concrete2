# Backend discharge-adapter gate (ROADMAP Phase 3 #13).
#
# Every status-changing backend is a typed `DischargeAdapter` with a DECLARED set
# of evidence classes it may produce; `DischargeAdapter.fold` applies a result
# only when the class is in that set. The firewall is therefore structural:
#   - the COMPILE-TIME `example`s in Concrete/Report/Report.lean prove smtAdapter /
#     runtimeAdapter / assumptionAdapter / oracleAdapter declare NO static-proof
#     class, and that the fold rejects a foreign class — kernel-checked, so a
#     green build already guarantees the firewall;
#   - this gate adds the BEHAVIORAL evidence over the CLI: discharge output is
#     byte-identical to the pre-#13 pipeline, an external solver cannot turn a
#     kernel-proved VC into solver evidence (nor manufacture kernel evidence),
#     and assumptions never read as a proof.
