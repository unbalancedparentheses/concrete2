# Array-bounds migration gate (ROADMAP Phase 3 #5).
#
# Phase 3 #5 routes array-bounds obligations through the unified `scopedWalk`
# collector. The collector threads strictly MORE sound facts than the old bounds
# walker (enclosing guards, negated guards, early-return fall-through, loop
# invariants), so a bounds obligation can only move `unproven → proved`, never
# the reverse. Verified against the pre-#5 binary across the fixed-array corpus:
#
#   • 9/10 files with bounds VCs: ZERO drift — exact-stable.
#   • hmac_sha256: ids/statuses unchanged; the four bounds VCs merely GAINED the
#     enclosing key-length guard as a hypothesis (k_len>64 / k_len≤64) — a sound
#     enrichment that doesn't bound the index, so status stays unproven.
#   • adversarial fixture: only the two documented `unproven → proved`
#     improvements; the negative controls stay unproven.
#
# This gate freezes that behavior as a permanent, self-contained regression guard
# (no old binary needed in CI).
