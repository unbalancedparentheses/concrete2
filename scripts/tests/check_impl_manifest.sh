# R-0004 slice 6 — the implementation manifest, MEASURED ON THE REAL CORPUS.
#
# WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. `implementationManifestResultOf` had no consumers, so its completeness
# conditions were pinned only by SYNTHETIC results in check_dependency_edges.sh. Synthetic probes
# prove the function refuses what it is handed; they cannot tell you whether real production is
# complete. And the producer this replaced could not have told us either: `filterMap` returned the
# subset it managed to build, which is byte-indistinguishable from a complete manifest.
#
# THE FIRST MEASUREMENT FOUND A REAL INCOMPLETENESS (2026-08-13): across the corpus, 64 identities
# are expected and 63 produce rows. One entry in examples/proof_pressure/src/main.con has no
# extracted proof-model body, so it is refused as `extracted-missing` and that file's manifest is
# correctly NOT usable. Under the old producer that file yielded a 4-row manifest reporting nothing
# wrong. The incompleteness was always there; only its visibility changed.
#
# SHADOW. Nothing consumes this manifest yet. The gate asserts what the producer reports, not that
# any verdict depends on it — and the fact that one file is not usable must NOT be "fixed" by
# loosening the condition. It is the true state.
