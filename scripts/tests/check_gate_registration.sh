# EVERY GATE IS REACHABLE FROM CI, OR EXPLICITLY SKIPPED WITH A REASON.
#
# This exists because eight R-0004 gates — the replay producer, receipt issuance and consumption,
# the V2 migration plan, clean-checkout reproducibility, build identity, the Slice 8 adversarial
# suite, the attestation manifest — were written, passed when run by hand, and were absent from
# `.github/workflows/lean_action_ci.yml`. That file is where `run_ci_gates_local.sh` derives its
# gate list, so nothing ever ran them again: not on the next commit, not for anyone else. A fully
# green local pass certified the entire evidence path while executing none of it.
#
# ABSENCE IS QUIETER THAN FAILURE, which is the whole problem. A failing gate is loud and gets
# fixed. A gate nobody runs looks exactly like a gate that passes, and the pass count keeps rising
# while coverage does not. `check_snapshots.sh` sat outside CI long enough to accumulate eleven real
# drifts, visible only as another gate's one-line "snapshot gate failed"; `check_v1_fingerprint_golden.sh`
# was invoked only by the convergence inventory, which discarded its stderr and read the silence as
# "inconclusive".
#
# REACHABILITY IS TRANSITIVE, and it is computed as a real closure rather than assumed to be one or
# two hops. A gate invoked by `run_fast_surface_gates.sh` IS run by CI, because that aggregator is
# itself a workflow step. Demanding a direct entry for each would be noise — about a dozen gates are
# aggregated that way and are perfectly well covered.
#
# The first version of this gate walked ONE level and asserted in its own comment that one level was
# enough for the aggregators this repository has. It was not: `check_roadmap_linear.sh` is reached as
# workflow -> run_fast_surface_gates.sh -> check_docs_drift.sh -> it, and the gate reported a covered
# file as unreachable. A fixpoint costs a few lines and cannot be wrong about depth.

# Reachability was `grep -q "$b" "$file"`: the gate's NAME appearing anywhere counted, including in
# a comment. `check_classification_freshness.sh` was certified reachable solely because
# check_dependency_edges.sh contains the prose line "Table freshness lives in
# check_classification_freshness.sh, NOT here" — a sentence saying the gate runs somewhere else read
# as proof that it runs. Measured at 0df0d264: four gates had no non-comment reference anywhere,
# three of them were RED, and CI had never executed any while this gate reported full reachability.
#
# A reference counts only from a comment-stripped line carrying an execution context. The direction
# is deliberately CONSERVATIVE: a gate invoked in a form this cannot see is reported unreachable and
# must be registered or skipped explicitly, which demands clarity rather than granting a silent pass.
#
# A '#' is only a comment when it starts a word. Stripping every '#' destroyed the real invocation
# `nix develop .#provers --command bash ./scripts/tests/check_bv_certificates.sh`, whose flake
# selector contains one, and reported a registered gate as unreachable.
#
# ONE SCAN PER FILE, NOT ONE PER PAIR. Testing each (file, candidate) pair separately meant two
# processes for each of ~220x220 pairs per fixpoint round; the gate went from a second to being
# killed at five minutes. The adjacency is built once — each file scanned for every gate name in a
# single pass — and the fixpoint then walks it with no further subprocesses.

  #      how test_mutation.sh does it via `gate_for_last "scripts/tests/check_foo.sh"`. CI runs the
  #      full campaign (workflow step "Gate mutation coverage ... heavy; rebuilds per mutation"), so
