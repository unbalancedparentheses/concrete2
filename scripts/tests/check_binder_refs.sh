# R-0004: binder references emitted during elaboration, as RELATIVE lexical
# positions.
#
# Three forcing properties, because each is satisfiable by a broken producer that
# passes the other two:
#   1. A scope that binds NOTHING must not shift framesOut.
#   2. Binding TIMING is construct-specific — lets, loop variables and arm patterns
#      are not interchangeable, and testing only lets proves nothing about arms.
#   3. A construct that cannot be given a semantic identity must mark the subject
#      UNCOVERED, never silently emit nothing.
