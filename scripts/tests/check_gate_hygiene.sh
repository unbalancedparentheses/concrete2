# Gate-hygiene gate (ROADMAP #34b enforcement).
#
# "Fail means fail" must be uniform across the whole gate corpus. Twice (2026-06
# and 2026-07) CI stayed green while a gate was silently masking failures — a
# `cmd | tail` swallowing a nonzero exit, or a fail-counter that never turned
# into a nonzero exit code. `scripts/tests/lib/gate.sh` fixed the ergonomics;
# this gate LOCKS IN the invariant so a new hand-rolled gate can't regress it.
#
# Every shell gate (check_*.sh / test_*.sh) must:
#   1. be pipe-safe   — source lib/gate.sh, OR set `pipefail` itself; and
#   2. propagate fail — contain at least one failure-exit construct
#                       (`exit N`, a trailing `[ "$FAIL" -eq 0 ]`, `gate_finish`,
#                       `|| exit`, `return 1`, …) so a detected failure becomes a
#                       nonzero process exit.
#
# It is a source-structure gate (no compiler build needed) and runs in the
# `grammar` CI job next to the workflow-YAML gate.
