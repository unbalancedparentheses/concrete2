# THE MINT-BATCH ACCOUNTING CONTROLS, ACTUALLY RUN.
#
# `check_dependency_edges.sh` batches its receipt-minting probes — EXPECTED_MINT_PROBES of them,
# pinned in that gate rather than counted again here — into one kernel replay,
# which is sound only because the batch reconciles what it ASKED FOR against what it was ANSWERED:
# a missing result, a duplicate result, a foreign result, a failed replay, a broken probe or a
# grouping failure must each turn the gate red rather than shrink a green total.
#
# Those controls existed as environment-gated branches inside that gate and NOTHING INVOKED THEM.
# An unreachable control is documentation: it can rot, or be quietly disabled, and no run notices.
# Worse, the normal 315-assertion run exercises none of them, so the accounting they protect was
# asserted only by having been tested once, by hand, months from whenever this is read.
#
# This gate runs each one and requires it to FAIL for its own reason. Every case names the marker it
# expects, so a control that starts passing for an unrelated reason is not mistaken for coverage.
#
# It is deliberately a separate gate: it runs the dependency-edge gate repeatedly, which is minutes
# per case, and burying that inside the gate it tests would make the common path pay for it.
