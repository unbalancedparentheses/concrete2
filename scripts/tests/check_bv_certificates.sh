# Independent DRAT check of bv_decide's bit-blasting.
#
# docs/verification/AXIOMS.md records a real trust extension: `bv_decide` proves a goal by
# bit-blasting to SAT and validating the solver's LRAT certificate, but that
# validation runs as COMPILED LEAN (Lean.ofReduceBool / Lean.trustCompiler). So a
# theorem "proved by kernel-checked bitblasting" is not kernel-only — six named
# theorems in the SHA-256 refinement stack currently rest on it.
#
# This gate does not remove that trust. It CORROBORATES it with a separately
# implemented checker: the exact CNF Lean bit-blasted is captured (via a sat.solver
# shim, since Lean exposes no option to retain it), independently re-solved, and its
# DRAT certificate verified by drat-trim — a different implementation, in C, by
# different authors. A bug in Lean's native LRAT checker alone therefore cannot make
# an unsound bitblasting claim pass unnoticed.
#
# Honest boundary: drat-trim is itself unverified C. Two independent checkers
# agreeing is strictly better than one, and strictly weaker than a verified checker
# (cake_lpr, which is not packaged in nixpkgs — see the report in docs).
#
# Skip-if-absent: cadical ships with Lean, but drat-trim comes from
# `nix develop .#provers`, so this is a no-op in the default shell.
