# Div/mod + sound-division-lowering migration gate (ROADMAP Phase 3 #6).
#
# Phase 3 #6 routes `divisor ≠ 0` obligations through the unified `scopedWalk`
# collector (fourth family, after asserts, call-site preconditions, bounds). The
# collector threads guards / negated guards / fall-through / loop invariants, so
# a divisor obligation can only move `unproven → proved`, never the reverse.
#
# The migration touched ONLY the scope walker. The SOUND division/modulo lowering
# (`divSound`/`toLeanPropSound`) is unchanged: a `/`/`%` is lowered to Lean
# E-division ONLY when the dividend is provably non-negative, because Concrete
# truncates toward zero while Lean `Int` floors. Verified against the pre-#6
# binary: every div VC across the corpus is byte-identical, and the sound-lowering
# behaviour (an assert containing `/` is proved under a `0 ≤ n` guard but NOT
# lowered without it) is unchanged.
#
# This gate freezes both the divisor migration and the truncate-vs-floor guard.
