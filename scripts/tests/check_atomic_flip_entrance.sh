# THE ATOMIC-FLIP ENTRANCE ASSERTION (R-0004 package 2).
#
# Before the `CallableId` evidence join is replaced by `DefinitionIdentity`, a specific set of
# conditions must hold TOGETHER. They were written in the roadmap as prose, which is exactly the
# shape that lets a flip proceed on a remembered version of the state rather than a measured one —
# and this project has already caught two prose conversion figures that had drifted.
#
# SEPARATE FROM `check_attestation_manifest.sh` ON PURPOSE. That gate reports progress, and it is
# deliberately GREEN while tables are pending: a pending table honestly reporting zero is not a
# failure. So its success can never be the entrance signal. This gate asserts the finished state,
# and is red until the flip is genuinely safe to perform.
#
# It measures; it does not restate. Every number comes from the manifest generator, the compiler, or
# the Lean environment, and no figure is written here that a producer could supply.
