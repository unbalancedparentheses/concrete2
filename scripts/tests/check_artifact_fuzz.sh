# R-0462 — fuzz the COMPILED BINARY against the safety claims.
#
# Register A asserts: if the obligation holds, the runtime property holds. R-0460 discharges
# that as theorems, row by row. This is the empirical shadow of the same statement, and it
# reaches something no theorem in this repo does: it runs the artifact, so it crosses
# surface -> Core -> SSA -> LLVM, which NO register row covers.
#
# Distinct from `--report bridge-check`, which evaluates the OBLIGATION on sampled inputs and
# looks for one that refutes it. That tests an obligation against a model. This tests the
# CLAIM against the thing that ships.
#
# H23 is the existence proof: a bounds obligation read `proved_by_multi_kernel (3: lean, rocq,
# isabelle)` and the binary aborted on its first run. Every kernel-side surface reported
# success. A fuzzer pointed at the binary catches it in seconds — which is what this does.
#
# Method: `--report artifact-fuzz` emits a `#[test]` driver calling every fuzzable function
# with inputs its `#[requires]` admits; append it to the source and run `--test`, which
# compiles via clang and executes. Exit 134 (SIGABRT) means a trap.
