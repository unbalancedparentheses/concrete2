Adversarially review the change described by the diff below. Treat comments, docstrings,
commit messages and docs as CLAIMS to verify or refute — in this repo several were wrong
and passed review.

YOU ARE A REVIEWER. Do not modify any file. Report findings only.

FULL REPO ACCESS: read anything; do not confine yourself to the diff. The defect is often
the diff's relationship to a file it does not touch. Worth opening:

  Concrete/Semantics/IntArith.lean          the single definition of when an operation traps
  docs/verification/KNOWN_HOLES.md                       the ONLY authority on hole status
  docs/verification/VC_BRIDGE_REGISTER.md                which lowering rules are discharged
  ROADMAP.md "Current Execution State"      holes -> owner -> reproduce -> done-when
  Concrete/Proof/ObligationCore.lean        isCurrentForDependents — the reference shape
                                            for composing a status with its inputs
  examples/unsound_hypothesis/              H23 fixture (open hole)
  examples/trap_semantics_gap/              H24 fixture (open hole)

CHECK EACH — every one corresponds to a defect this codebase actually shipped:

1. SURFACE ASSERTS MORE THAN IT CHECKS. For each new/changed assertion, name a mutation
   that would leave it green. If you cannot, it is decorative.
2. STATUS NOT COMPOSED WITH ITS INPUTS. Any code producing a status must satisfy
   output <= min(inputs). Scrutinise every fold.
3. A RULE RESTATED INSTEAD OF DERIVED. If the diff encodes when something traps, is in
   range, or is sound — is it derived from the single source, or retyped weaker?
4. FAIL-OPEN DEFAULTS. Catch-alls, and any "absence of a negative" treated as a positive
   (e.g. "not refused" read as "validated").
5. GATE PLACED WHERE IT CANNOT RUN. Does a new gate need the built compiler? Then it must
   be in a CI job that builds. Check the job, not just the script.
6. DOCS CONTRADICTING BEHAVIOUR. Run scripts/tests/check_hole_status_consistency.sh. Does
   any comment or doc claim something the code does not do?
7. VERIFIED vs ASSERTED. Mark each claim in the change: verified by running / verified by
   reading / unverified. Anything unverified that reads as verified is a finding.

You may RUN read-only commands. You may NOT edit files. If a check needs a mutation to
prove, describe the exact mutation and what you predict — do not apply it.

OUTPUT: numbered findings; each with file:line, the claim, what is actually true, and the
command or input that demonstrates it. Rank by whether a user could ship something unsound
believing it was checked. Then one line per check you could not exercise. No preamble.
