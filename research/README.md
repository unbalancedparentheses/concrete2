# Research Notes

Status: exploratory index

This directory contains design notes, open questions, architectural explorations, and long-horizon ideas for Concrete.

These files are exploratory unless they explicitly say otherwise. Once a design becomes a stable project rule or implementation contract, it should move into `docs/`.

## How To Use This Directory

- use `ROADMAP.md` for active project sequencing
- use `docs/` for stable rules and implementation contracts
- use `research/` for design work that is still being explored, sharpened, or staged for later phases

## Priority Key

- `P0` = highest-value current research, directly connected to active or next roadmap phases
- `P1` = important follow-on research, likely to matter in later phases
- `P2` = useful background, optional direction, or long-horizon exploration

## Status Key

- `Open` = still exploratory
- `Adopted` = design influenced implementation, but the note remains useful as background
- `Excluded` = intentionally not in the language surface
- `Process` = decision filter or project rule
- `Research` = broader exploration, not a current design commitment

## Placement Rule

- stable rule/reference -> `docs/`
- active plan/sequencing -> `ROADMAP.md`
- landed milestone/history -> `CHANGELOG.md`
- exploratory note -> `research/`

The roadmap should only absorb items from here when they become concrete technical work.
