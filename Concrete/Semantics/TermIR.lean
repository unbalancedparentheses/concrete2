# Typed term IR for prover-neutral obligations (R-0455, slice 1)

The current lowering fuses three jobs into string templates plus an exit code: how to SAY
the obligation, how to TRY to prove it, and how to BELIEVE the answer. Every defect R-0455
names follows from that fusion — `div`/`mod` sub-terms dropped because the operator table is
infix-only, spec-function calls dropped because there are no uninterpreted symbols, and a
whole cloned driver (`rocqNiaLowering`) existing to change one word in a proof script.

This module is the first half of the fix: a typed term IR that both sides of a
transformation are expressed in, so a transformation can be *stated* and therefore *proved*.

## Why this is Register B and not a refactor

Why3, whose shape this adopts, does not prove its transformations — they are trusted. Here
each transformation owes **transformed goal implies input goal**, as a theorem over this IR.
That is tractable in a way Register A is not: a syntactic claim relating two representations
of the same term over a small fragment, rather than a semantic claim about program execution.

## What this module deliberately does NOT attempt

Print fidelity. Proving "this printer emits syntax denoting the same proposition" needs a
formal semantics of the TARGET syntax, and there is none for SMT-LIB or Coq's parser that is
ours. Formalising them relocates the trust rather than removing it. The honest split, from
`docs/PROVER_NEUTRAL_OBLIGATIONS.md`:

  obligation → transformed goal   both sides ours   PROVABLE — this module's scope
  transformed goal → target text  target not ours   validated, plausibly forever

## One design decision worth stating

`evalTerm` below is **structurally recursive, not `partial`**. That is not stylistic. The
reference evaluator this IR will eventually replace (`ReportObligations.evalIntEnv`) is a
`partial def`, so the kernel cannot reduce it and no theorem or `rfl` example can say
anything about its behaviour — the evaluator every lowering-agreement check measures against
is itself outside the reach of proof. Recursing on an explicit fuel-free structural argument
is what buys the theorems at the bottom of this file.

/-- Terms. `sym` is an UNINTERPRETED symbol — the other stated defect: spec-function calls
    are dropped today because the string layer has no way to carry a symbol it cannot
    interpret. Here it is carried, and a driver that cannot express it must transform rather
    than silently drop it. -/

  | bin  (op : Op) (l r : Term)
  | un   (op : Op) (a : Term)
  /-- A width-changing cast, carrying the TARGET's width and signedness.

      Modelled rather than dropped, and modelled as a WRAP rather than as identity. The
      reference (`Interp.evalCast`) is `IntArith.wrapToType`: `as` keeps the low bits, a
      silent two's-complement truncation. Treating a cast as transparent would make the IR
      denote a different value than the program computes — the silent misinterpretation this
      IR exists to remove — so it is carried with the parameters that decide the wrap.

      Measured motivation: before this node existed, every obligation carrying a division
      subterm ALSO carried a cast (`arr[(a / b) as Int]`), so it was dropped by the IR too and
      the IR recovered nothing. -/

/-! ## Evaluation

Two mutually-defined evaluators over an environment. Structural recursion, so the kernel can
reduce them and the soundness theorems below are provable.

`Option` rather than a default: a term outside the fragment, or a variable with no binding,
yields `none` and every operator propagates it. Guessing a value would let a transformation
look sound on inputs where the reference has no opinion — the same fail-open shape this
codebase keeps finding.
-/

/-- Uninterpreted symbols are given meaning by an oracle, not by this evaluator. A
    transformation must be sound for EVERY oracle, which is exactly what "uninterpreted"
    means and what makes the quantification in the theorems below load-bearing. -/
abbrev SymEnv := String → List Int → Option Int

/-- Boolean variable bindings.

    `evalBool` used to return `none` for `.var _`, so a boolean VARIABLE was not evaluable at
    all. That is fine while every obligation is arithmetic — a bool-sorted variable never
    appears — and fatal the moment a non-arithmetic obligation exists, because the
    lowering-agreement check measures every rendering against this evaluator. Without bool
    bindings, a boolean goal could be lowered to Rocq/Isabelle/Lean and NOTHING could confirm
    the three lowerings mean the same proposition. -/

/-! ## Register B row 1 — `eliminate_div_mod`

The transformation the string layer could not express, and therefore dropped.

`a / b` inside a larger expression is replaced by a fresh variable `q`, with the defining
constraints added as hypotheses. The divisor-nonzero *obligation* was never affected — only
`div`/`mod` occurring inside a bigger term — which is why the defect was easy to miss and
why it is worth a theorem rather than a comment.

**The row's obligation is `transformed goal implies input goal`**, and the direction matters.
A transformation may STRENGTHEN (prove more than needed) without unsoundness; it may never
weaken. So the theorem shows: if the transformed goal holds in an environment extended with
the witness, the original goal holds in the original environment.

Difficulty, recorded because R-0455 says the register must: this row is a REWRITING argument
and lands. `eliminate_algebraic` — axiomatizing datatypes conservatively — is
model-theoretic, and is deliberately not attempted here. -/

/-! ### Register B row 1 — `eliminate_tmod`

**The transformation:** rewrite every `a tmod b` into `a - b * (a tdiv b)`.

This is what R-0455 means by "a driver states what a target *cannot* express so the pipeline
transforms instead of silently dropping". A target with quotient but no remainder currently
loses the subterm; here it gets an equivalent term over the operators it does have. The
operator set a driver must support shrinks by one, which is the same lever that makes
`rocqNiaLowering` — a whole cloned driver existing to change one word — unnecessary.

**Why this row and not `eliminate_div_mod` (substitute a fresh variable):** substitution needs
decidable equality on `Term`, which Lean cannot derive through the nested `List Term` in `sym`
and which must therefore be hand-written. An earlier attempt here compared terms by their
`repr` STRINGS — the same category of error as validating a rendering by reading it back. And
the fresh-variable version's real content is the magnitude constraint `|r| < |b|`, which needs
`Int.natAbs` reasoning this repo has no Mathlib for. Both are recorded as open rows below
rather than approximated. Difficulty is skewed and R-0455 says the register must say so. -/

mutual
