# Trust edges — the canonical, DIRECT facts about where rawness enters

Four edge kinds, per function, and nothing else:

  callsTrusted X   this function calls a `trusted` declaration
  callsFFI Y       this function calls an `extern` declaration
  containsRawOp Z  this function performs a raw operation (Z names which)
  assumesUnsafe W  this function declares `with(Unsafe)` — the caller owes an
                   unchecked precondition

WHY DIRECT EDGES AND NOT A SUMMARY. A `usesUnsafe` boolean, or a stored transitive
closure, is a second producer of a fact the call graph already determines, and it drifts:
today 292 public std functions reach a raw root while only 154 declare `Unsafe`, so the
declarations are ALREADY an incomplete provenance system, off by 138. Reports derive paths
and closure from these edges; nothing hand-maintains the answer.

WHAT AN EDGE IS NOT. It is a RECORD of where rawness is, never a LICENSE for it. Derived
provenance does not authorize a raw operation. Every raw operation must be justified by
being inside a `trusted` implementation, or by a declared caller obligation. std does not
satisfy that invariant today — 47 raw roots are neither `pub` nor `trusted` — and these
edges are what make that measurable rather than assumed.

THE THREE FACTS THESE KEEP APART (the same separation as R-0484's requires/carries/performs):
  - operational authority  `with(File, Alloc, ...)` — unchanged, orthogonal, and NEVER
    erased by `trusted`;
  - caller safety obligation  `assumesUnsafe` — the caller must uphold an invariant the
    language cannot establish;
  - trust provenance  the other three edges — the implementation depends on raw
    operations, FFI, or an audited assertion.

An API may be safe to CALL while raw INSIDE (`Vec::push`), which is why provenance must
not propagate as a caller requirement.

/-- Per-function attributes a consumer needs that are NOT edges.

    THE JUSTIFICATION INVARIANT needs this. "Every raw operation must be justified — by
    sitting inside a trusted implementation, or by a declared caller obligation" is not
    decidable from the edges alone: `callsTrusted` says something about CALLEES, and the
    invariant asks whether the CONTAINING function is trusted. Kept separate from the
    edge list rather than smuggled in as a fifth edge kind, because it is a property of a
    declaration, not a relation between two. -/
