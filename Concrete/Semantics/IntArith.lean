# Integer arithmetic semantics — the single source of truth

Phase 6.5 #1. Integer arithmetic meaning was hand-maintained in several stages:
the interpreter (`Interp.evalBinOp`), constant folding / DCE (`SSACleanup`),
and backend checked-helper selection (`EmitSSA`). Each had its own copy of "bit
width", "in range?", "does this fold trap?". When those drift, a fold or a
helper can disagree with the interpreter — which is the oracle for differential
testing — and a documented trap can silently vanish (three such soundness holes
were found and fixed when the checked-arithmetic flip landed; see
`docs/ARITHMETIC_POLICY.md`).

This module is the one place that decides:
* `intBitWidth` — bit width and signedness of each fixed-width integer type;
* `intRange` — the inclusive representable range;
* `checkedToType` / `wrapToType` / `saturateToType` / `maskWidth` — the four
  value-normalisation operations backing checked / `wrapping_*` / `saturating_*`
  / unsigned-mask semantics;
* `tdiv` / `tmod` — truncated division and remainder (LLVM `sdiv`/`srem`);
* `evalIntBinOp` — the tri-state evaluation of a binary op on two integer
  values, whose result is one of {value, trap, not-applicable}.

`Interp` evaluates through `evalIntBinOp`; `SSACleanup` asks `foldIntBinOp`
whether a constant fold is legal AND whether it would trap; `EmitSSA` derives
its checked-helper width from `llvmBitWidth`. There is intentionally NO new
policy here — every definition reproduces the behaviour the stages already had,
now stated once.

This is deliberately a leaf module (imports only the AST) so every stage can
depend on it without a cycle.

/-- The outcome of evaluating / folding an integer binary op on two integer
    operands. The three cases are mutually exclusive and must all be handled:

    * `value n ty` — the operation is defined and produces `n : ty`;
    * `trap msg`   — the operation is defined to TRAP at this input (overflow,
                     divide-by-zero, signed `MIN / -1`, shift out of range).
                     A constant fold MUST NOT turn this into a value, and DCE
                     MUST NOT delete the operation;
    * `notApplicable` — this op/type combination is not an integer arithmetic
                     op handled here (e.g. comparisons, bool ops, a non-integer
                     operand). The caller falls back to its own handling.

    (trap on overflow / zero / signed-MIN-over-neg-one), `wrapping_*`
    (two's-complement wrap), and `saturating_*` (clamp); `/ %` use truncated
    division. Every other op returns `.notApplicable`.

    Shifts and bitwise ops are intentionally NOT handled here — they are simple
    enough that callers apply the reference's small helpers directly
    (`shiftAmountInRange` for the trap check, `maskWidth` for the shift result,
    `bitwiseAtWidth` for `& | ^`). Keeping them out of the tri-state evaluator

    no unary case at all and deleted discarded negations, silently removing the
    documented MIN trap (bug 053). The folder's own comment next door said
    "leave the op live so the checked negation helper traps at runtime" — the

/-! ### Trap conditions as first-class data (R-0464 / H24)

`evalIntBinOp` above is the authority on *whether* a checked op traps at given values.
Obligation generation cannot call it — an obligation is a proposition about symbolic
operands, not a computation on two `Int`s — so it stated its own trap conditions, and stated
them weaker: `divObligations` emitted only `divisor ≠ 0`, missing the signed `MIN / -1`
quotient overflow, and no family collected shifts at all. `collectArithE` matches only
`.add | .sub | .mul`, so nothing else covered them either. Both faults are reproduced in
`examples/trap_semantics_gap/`.

The fix is not to duplicate the rules more carefully. It is to name, in ONE place, which
conditions a checked op owes — then hold that enumeration to `evalIntBinOp` by kernel-checked
example, and hold obligation generation to the enumeration by totality. A new trap rule then
cannot be added to the evaluator without breaking a lock here, and cannot be listed here
without a family claiming it.
-/

/-- One condition a checked operation must discharge to be trap-free. Data, not a
    proposition, so both the evaluator lock below and obligation generation can pattern
    match on it exhaustively — the same discipline as `HypOrigin` in Register C, and for the
    same reason: a catch-all would give a newly added condition zero obligations, silently. -/

    Read off `evalIntBinOp`'s trap branches, and locked to them by the examples below rather
    than by trust. `wrapping_*` and `saturating_*` are absent because they are defined not to
    trap; comparison and boolean ops carry no integer trap.

    `bitand`/`bitor`/`bitxor` are total on in-range operands and appear with `[]` for the same
    reason — stated explicitly rather than falling into a catch-all, so that adding a trapping
    bitwise op forces a decision here. -/

If `evalIntBinOp` traps on a `/` or `%` at these inputs, some condition in
`trapConditions` must be false there. These are the exact inputs the gap was reproduced at,
so a regression is a build failure. -/
