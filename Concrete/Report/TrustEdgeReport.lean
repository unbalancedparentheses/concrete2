# `--report trust-edges` — the canonical direct trust facts, one line each

Emits only DIRECT edges. Paths and transitive closure are derived by whatever consumes
this, never stored: a stored closure is a second producer of something the call graph
already determines, and it drifts. Today 292 public std functions reach a raw root while
154 declare `Unsafe` — the declarations are already an incomplete provenance system, off
by 138, which is the drift this format exists to stop.

Tab-separated and sorted, so the inventory is byte-reproducible and diffable.

THE `unjustified-raw-op` LINES ARE THE POINT. A raw operation must be justified — by
sitting inside a `trusted` implementation, or by a declared caller obligation. Derived
provenance records where rawness is; it never authorizes it. Any function listed there
performs a raw operation with neither justification.
