# Obligation generation as a calculus — slice 1

Implements the structure in `docs/verification/VC_GENERATOR_DESIGN.md`: **one traversal plus a per-constructor
rule table**, replacing four hand-written walkers over the same grammar.

## Why, in one number

Nine discovery defects were found in 2026-08. Every one was "an obligation in syntactic position X
is lost", and every one existed because the same traversal is written eight times (four expression
walkers, four leaves) and nothing forces them to agree. Two examples, both found mechanically in
the last hour rather than by review:

* a shift inside an `if`-EXPRESSION produced no obligation — three sibling walkers had the case,
  the fourth never did;
* a division inside `assert(a / b > 0)` produced none — all eight lacked it.

Neither is a discipline failure. Keeping eight copies of one traversal consistent by hand is a
design problem, and this file is the design fix: **there is one recursion, and adding a family is
a row rather than a walker.**

## Status: SHADOW ONLY

Nothing consumes this yet. It exists to be diffed against the existing walkers
(`--report vcgen-diff`), which are a usable oracle now that their nine defects are fixed and
gated. Every difference is a finding either way — the walker missed something, or this did.
Switching consumers over comes only when the diff is empty or every remaining entry is explained
in writing.

/-- The rule table: what THIS node requires, with no recursion in it.

    This is the whole point of the design. A walker mixes "what does this node need" with "how do
    I reach the next node", so a family is a traversal and eight of them drift. Here the first
    question is a flat table and the second is `vcExpr` below, written once.

    Two obligation kinds that do not exist anywhere today are one line each when they are wanted:
    `MIN` negation (`unaryOp .neg`) and float→int casts. Both trap at runtime with nothing
    generated, and that they were skipped is evidence about the old structure's cost, not about
    their difficulty. -/

/-! ## `wp` over statements — the path condition, accumulated rather than threaded

`scopedWalk` carries the enclosing hypotheses by hand: it appends the guard on the then-branch,
`negateGuard c` on the else-branch, loop hypotheses in bodies, and calls `dropStaleHyps` when a
statement reassigns a variable a hypothesis mentions.

Those are the `if` and `while` rules of a weakest-precondition calculus, written out longhand. Here
they fall out of the recursion, which is the second half of the design's claim: **one mechanism
replaces two.**

Reassignment is where this got a claim wrong, and the correction is worth keeping. `scopedWalk`
DROPS any hypothesis mentioning a reassigned variable; WP would SUBSTITUTE
(`wp(x := e, Q) = Q[x := e]`), which is strictly stronger — after `d = d - 1` the fact `d != 0`
becomes `d - 1 != 0` and survives, where dropping loses it.

An earlier version of this comment concluded that the calculus should therefore RETAIN the
hypothesis, and that a divergence from the walker would be the calculus being right. That was
wrong: substitution is stronger, but retaining WITHOUT substituting is neither — it keeps a fact
about the old value and calls it a fact about the new one. On
`div_scope_adversarial.stale` — `if d != 0 { d = d - 1; return n / d; }` — it proves a division
safe that is not. The differential found it on the single fixture built for the purpose.

So this slice DROPS, matching the walker. Substitution is the principled replacement and is future
work; until it exists, dropping is the sound choice and the stronger-sounding option is a bug. -/

/-- WP's SEQUENTIAL rule, and the reason a per-statement `flatMap` is not enough.

    After `if c { return … }` the remaining statements run only when `¬c`, so the path condition
    for the tail must gain `negateGuard c`. `scopedWalk` implements this as its fall-through case;
    without it the calculus loses a hypothesis the walker has, which the differential caught on
    `fmt.format_int` (`10 | value != 0` there, `10 |` here).
