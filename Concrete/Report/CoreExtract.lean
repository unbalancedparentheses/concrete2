/-! # Core → Rocq extraction: a DIFFERENTIAL TEST of Core semantics

What this is, stated narrowly on purpose. It extracts a Core function into a Rocq
(Gallina) computation and cross-checks it against Concrete's Lean interpreter:

  * the interpreter evaluates `f(args)` — the existing oracle, already trusted enough
    to be the differential-testing reference for codegen;
  * the extracted definition is evaluated by Rocq's kernel, by asking it to check
    `Goal f_ext args = <interpreter's result>. Proof. reflexivity. Qed.`

`reflexivity` on closed integer arithmetic is decided by Rocq's own kernel reduction,
so agreement means two independently-implemented evaluators computed the same value,
and disagreement is a defect in one of them.

## What it does NOT establish

It is NOT bridge diversity, and earlier drafts of this module oversold it as such.
`--report multi-kernel` declines to attest that the **Core→obligation lowering** is
faithful — that lowering turns a Core body into a proposition like
`a+b ∈ [-2³¹, 2³¹-1]`, including collecting hypotheses. Nothing here checks that the
emitted obligation is the right safety condition for that site, or that its
hypotheses were gathered correctly. This module cross-checks Core's SEMANTICS; the
obligation-derivation step is attacked separately, and only partially, by the
`bridge-check` fuzzer (does a *proved* obligation get refuted by concrete execution).
Together they narrow the gap from two sides; neither proves faithfulness.

Nor is it a second bridge whose agreement reduces trust: two unverified translators
agreeing is evidence, not proof, and this one is a real component that can itself be
wrong — two bugs were found in it during development (definitions referencing
unextractable callees; and, in the sibling agreement check, Isabelle inferring a
fresh type variable per numeral). The sanctioned path to bridge trust is realization
proofs / a discharged bridge register, not extraction.

What it IS worth: a cheap, falsifiable net that catches semantic modelling errors no
amount of kernel agreement can, because every kernel would agree on a consistently
mis-lowered obligation. Demonstrated: swapping `Z.quot` for `Z.div` (truncating →
flooring division) yields `DISAGREE — Unable to unify "-3" with "div_safe (-7) 2"`.
It covers the sampled inputs only, and it can be demoted or deleted once bridge
register rows are discharged.

## Deliberate semantic care

Two places where a naive extraction is silently wrong, and where this differential
test earns its keep:

* **Division truncates toward zero.** Concrete's `/` and `%` follow `Int.tdiv` /
  `Int.tmod`. Rocq's `Z.div`/`Z.modulo` are FLOOR division, which differs on
  negative operands (`(-7)/2` is `-3` truncating, `-4` flooring). We emit
  `Z.quot`/`Z.rem`, which truncate.
* **Fixed-width arithmetic is checked, and traps.** The interpreter traps on
  overflow exactly as the compiled binary does; Gallina `Z` is unbounded. Rather
  than model traps, the harness only compares inputs on which the interpreter
  SUCCEEDS. An input that traps is skipped, never counted as agreement.

## Fragment

Supported: integer and boolean locals, `let`/assignment, `if`/`else` (statement and
expression form), `return`, direct calls to other extractable functions, and the
arithmetic/comparison/logical operators below.

Not supported, and reported rather than silently dropped: loops (Gallina needs a
termination argument — a fuel-parameterised encoding is the natural next step),
structs, enums, arrays, matches, borrows, casts, generics, floats, strings.
-/

/-- Rocq type for a Concrete type, within the extractable fragment. Every integer
    width maps to `Z`: the extraction models the VALUE, and width-dependent
    trapping is handled by only comparing non-trapping inputs (see the module
    docstring). `none` for anything outside the fragment. -/

/-- Gallina spelling of a binary operator, as a prefix application over `Z`/`bool`.

    Comparisons use the BOOLEAN-valued operations (`Z.leb`, not `Z.le`), because the
    extracted function is a computation whose `if` conditions must reduce, not a
    proposition. `div`/`mod` use `Z.quot`/`Z.rem` (truncating), NOT `Z.div`/`Z.modulo`
    (flooring) — see the module docstring. -/
