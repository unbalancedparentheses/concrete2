# Non-arithmetic multi-kernel evidence: boolean postconditions

Every kernel-agreement demo before this one is **linear integer arithmetic** — `omega`, `lia`,
`presburger`. Three kernels agreeing on arithmetic is a real result, but it exercises one theory,
and each prover's decision procedure for it is mature and well-trodden.

This module carries the first NON-arithmetic obligation to all three kernels: a boolean
postcondition, discharged by case analysis rather than by an arithmetic decision procedure.

## Why booleans first, and not merely because they are easy

The multi-kernel claim does not rest on "three provers said yes". It rests on: each kernel closed
a lowering **whose truth table matches the reference evaluator**, which is what prevents a kernel
from proving a *different* proposition and having that counted. For a boolean goal over `n`
variables that check is **exhaustive** — all `2^n` assignments, no sampling. Arithmetic
obligations can only be checked on chosen instances, and an inductive property over unbounded
inputs could not be checked at all.

So booleans are the one rung of the ladder where faithfulness is *complete* rather than sampled.
That is a stronger agreement argument than the arithmetic tier has, on a weaker theory.

## Why Concrete `bool` maps to Rocq `bool`, not `Prop`

`Prop` would be unfaithful and would drag in axioms. Concrete's `bool` is two-valued and
decidable; Rocq's `Prop` is intuitionistic, so De Morgan's `~(a /\ b) -> ~a \/ ~b` is **not
provable** there without classical logic. Lowering to `Prop` would therefore either fail or
require `Classical`, which `Print Assumptions` would then report — turning an axiom-free
attestation into an axiom-bearing one for no reason. Over `bool` the same fact is
`destruct a, b; reflexivity`: constructive, and verified axiom-free
("Closed under the global context") against real `coqc`.

Isabelle/HOL is classical, so `by simp` closes it either way; Lean's `decide` needs the
decidable `Bool` for the same reason Rocq does. The three lowerings therefore agree on `bool`
and would NOT agree on `Prop` — which is itself a finding about cross-logic portability that
only a non-arithmetic obligation could surface.

    the `refinement` profile names and this does not attempt. -/

/-! ## The three lowerings

Each kernel gets a boolean rendering with its OWN decision procedure — not one shared arithmetic
tactic. That is the point of a non-arithmetic tier: `lia`/`presburger`/`omega` are useless here,
so agreement between the kernels is not three invocations of the same idea.

| kernel | sort | tactic | refusal marker (already known to the classifier) |
|--------|------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Rocq | `bool` | `destruct …; reflexivity` | `Unable to unify` |
| Isabelle/HOL | `bool` | `auto` (classical; `simp` is too weak — see below) | `Failed to finish proof` |
| Lean | `Bool` | `decide` | `decide` reports the proposition FALSE |

All three were validated against the real tools before any of this was wired up, including the
negative controls: a false boolean claim is REFUSED by each, with the marker above. -/

/-- Boolean operator spelling per kernel: `(and, or, not, eq)`. Rocq and Lean use the decidable
    `bool`/`Bool` operators; Isabelle's inner syntax is classical HOL but agrees on `bool`. -/
private structure BoolOps where
  and_ : String
  or_  : String
  not_ : String
  /-- TOP-LEVEL equivalence: the lemma's own `=`, at proposition level. -/
  eqv  : String
  /-- NESTED boolean equality, which is NOT the same thing. In Rocq `a = b` on `bool` is a
      `Prop`, so `negb (a = b)` is a type error — the emitted `xor` script failed exactly that
      way, while the `rfl` locks passed. Isabelle's HOL `=` on `bool` is already boolean, and
      Lean needs `==` because `=` yields a `Prop` there too. Three kernels, three answers to one
      question the renderer had been treating as uniform. -/

/-! # Rung 5 — uninterpreted functions (EUF)

A `spec fn f(x: i32) -> i32;` is body-less, pure and erased: an **uninterpreted function**. The
string lowering drops calls entirely today (`exprToProver` returns `none`), which is the
documented gap this closes.

## Two design decisions, both load-bearing

**The symbol becomes a QUANTIFIED FUNCTION VARIABLE, not a declared constant.** `Parameter f : Z
-> Z` in Rocq, or an `axiom` in Lean, would put a declaration into the trusted base and
`Print Assumptions` would report it — turning an axiom-free attestation into an axiom-bearing one.
Quantifying instead (`forall (f : Z -> Z), …`) proves the goal for EVERY interpretation of `f`,
which is both stronger and axiom-free. Verified: both Rocq lemmas report
"Closed under the global context".

**This tier has a SEPARATE renderer from the boolean one, deliberately.** EUF goals live at
proposition level (`(t = f m) <-> (f m = t)`); boolean postconditions live at `bool` level
(`(!a || !b) = !(a && b)`). Forcing one renderer to do both is exactly what produced the `xor`
type error — nested `a = b` emitted as a `bool` when it was a `Prop`. Two sorts, two renderers.

## What DEGRADES here, stated plainly

The boolean tier's agreement check is **exhaustive**: `2^n` assignments decide whether a lowering
means the same proposition. That is impossible for EUF — an uninterpreted symbol has infinitely
many interpretations, so there is no finite table to enumerate.

What replaces it is **propositional abstraction**: each distinct comparison containing a spec call
becomes a boolean atom, and the goal is checked as a propositional tautology over all assignments
to those atoms. That is **sound** — a propositional tautology holds under every interpretation of
the symbols — and **incomplete**: `x = y -> f x = f y` is EUF-valid but NOT a propositional
tautology over the atoms `x = y` and `f x = f y`, because the abstraction forgets that `f` is a
function. So a goal the reference check cannot confirm may still be closed by the kernels, and
this tier reports `abstraction: inconclusive` rather than claiming agreement.

That is the first rung where the reference check stops being decisive, and it is the same
trade the roadmap records for induction — one rung earlier and milder.

/-- Is the obligation a propositional TAUTOLOGY over its atoms?

    `some ()` — a tautology, therefore valid under EVERY interpretation of the uninterpreted
    symbols. This direction is sound.

    `none` — **inconclusive, and nothing more.** Propositional abstraction is sound in one
    direction only: a tautology implies validity, but a falsifying assignment implies NOTHING,
    because the abstraction forgets that `f` is a function. `m = t -> tag_of m = tag_of t` is
    EUF-valid and has a falsifying assignment under abstraction, since `m = t` and
    `tag_of m = tag_of t` are treated as unrelated atoms.

    An earlier version of this returned a third verdict, "FALSE under some assignment — no
    kernel should close it", which is simply wrong: it labelled congruence — the defining
    property of an uninterpreted function — as something no kernel should prove. Only the
    kernels can refute an EUF goal; the abstraction can only ever confirm. -/

/-- Lean SCRIPT, with named binders and explicit case analysis.

    Three things forced this shape, each found by running it:

    * `intros` produces INACCESSIBLE names (`tag_of✝`), so the atoms cannot be named in
      `by_cases` afterwards. The generator knows the binder names, so it introduces them
      explicitly.
    * `simp_all` alone does not close these. The De Morgan instance is
      `(A → ¬B) → ¬A ∨ ¬B`, which is **classically** valid and not constructively provable — and
      this repo has no Mathlib, so no `tauto`.
    * `by_cases` nonetheless needs no classical axiom here, because the atoms are `Int`
      equalities and therefore DECIDABLE. Case analysis on a decidable proposition is
      constructive.

    Honest cross-kernel difference: `#print axioms` reports `propext` for these (from
    `simp_all`), whereas Rocq reports "Closed under the global context". Lean's proofs here are
    not axiom-free in the strict sense; `propext` is a standard Lean axiom, not classical choice. -/

/-! # Rungs 6 + 7 — algebraic datatypes and arrays

Nothing currently tells any prover that a Concrete struct exists: `CoreExtract` emits Gallina
`Definition`s and no `Inductive`/`Record` at all. This tier emits the DECLARATION alongside the
lemma, so a structural obligation can be stated.

**Arrays come free.** A fixed-size Concrete array with every index already proved in range by the
bounds family is a total `index -> value` function, so it is rung 5's uninterpreted-symbol
machinery with no new theory. That is why rungs 6 and 7 land together: the array half needs a
renderer case, not a theory.

**Where the three kernels genuinely differ:** field projection. Rocq and Isabelle put the field
first (`magic h`), Lean puts it last (`h.magic`), and the declaration syntax differs three ways
(`Record` / `record` / `structure`). The proposition itself is otherwise shared.
