/-! # Scoped lexical binder frames (R-0004, ProofBodyCanonicalV2 prerequisite)

A body canonicalization must be alpha-invariant: renaming a local must not move the
digest, while *which* binder a reference resolves to must. That requires binder
identity to be a POSITION, and the position to be stable.

Raw `env.vars` indices are not such a position. Elaboration pushes and pops
variables as it walks branches, loops and temporaries, so the same source binder can
sit at different indices depending on the path taken to reach it — a digest that
moved when nothing semantic changed. This module supplies the alternative: an
explicit stack of frames whose shape is fixed by the program's lexical structure.

A reference is encoded RELATIVE: `b:<framesOut>:<indexInFrame>`. `framesOut` counts
scopes crossed outward from the reference, so a binder keeps its encoding when
unrelated frames are pushed elsewhere. That is the property `env.vars` lacked.

Deliberately NOT resolved here: whether a name refers to a field, variant or type.
Those need the owner's resolved type, which only elaboration has — an AST-level pass
sees `obj.field` with no way to know what `obj` is. ProofBodyCanonicalV2 therefore
belongs in elaboration, consuming resolved information, and this module is the part
that is genuinely independent of it.

/-- A lexical scope stack, innermost frame FIRST.

    One frame per binding construct: a function's parameters, a block's `let`s, a
    loop's induction variables, a match arm's pattern bindings. Frames are pushed
    and popped explicitly rather than inferred from assignments — the loop-contract
    encoder reconstructs scope from ASSIGNMENTS and that approximation cannot see a
    read-only outer local or a proof-only ghost, which is what made ghost-bearing
    invariants unencodable. -/

    than an error: a caller that pops too often has a bug, but silently corrupting
    the outer frames would make the bug appear as a digest change far away. -/

/-- Resolve a name to its RELATIVE position: frames crossed outward, then index
    within that frame.

    Innermost-first search, so an inner binder SHADOWS an outer one of the same
    name — matching the language's own scoping. Within one frame the LAST binder
    wins, because a frame's later `let` shadows an earlier one of the same name in
    the same block. Absent names return `none`; the canonicalizer must refuse
    rather than invent a position. -/

/-- Binders a statement introduces INTO ITS OWN enclosing frame, in source order.

    Exhaustive over `Stmt` with no wildcard: a new statement form must make an
    explicit decision here. A form that binds nothing returns `[]`; a form whose
    binders are scoped to a nested block does NOT contribute here, because those
    belong to the frame that block pushes.

    `letDecl` includes ghost bindings: a ghost is a binder, and omitting it is what
    made ghost-named invariants read as free identifiers. -/
