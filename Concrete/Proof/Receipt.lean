/-! # The proof-evidence receipt envelope (R-0004 slice 4)

**Declared future owner: `Concrete/Proof/Receipt/`.** Landed flat here because that directory
split depends on R-0114-R-0118 (see the repo-reorganization plan) and is premature; the header
records the intended home so the move is a rename rather than a rediscovery.

## What a receipt is for

A receipt says: *this evidence was established against exactly this subject, under exactly these
dependencies, in exactly this environment.* Its value is entirely in what it BINDS — a receipt
that omits something is not a weaker receipt, it is a receipt that silently claims independence
from whatever it left out.

## The design commitment: unbindable evidence is UNREPRESENTABLE, not rejected

`EdgeEvidence.tablesFullyBound` is a predicate, and a predicate can be forgotten. The type here
is built so it cannot be:

* `tableBindings : List (Name × String)` — a digest per table, **not** `Option String`. There is
  no way to put an unbound table inside a receipt, so no consumer has to remember to check.
* the structure constructor is PRIVATE and `Inhabited` is not derived, so `mint` really is the
  only way to obtain one. Both were missing in the first version, and the claim below was
  therefore false: a caller could build a receipt with an empty subject and the current schema
  version, and `default` produced one with an empty schema.
* `ReceiptMaterial.of?` returns `Option` and refuses when any named table is unbound, when the
  digests do not correspond to the named tables IDENTITY-wise, when a table is bound twice, when
  the subject digest is absent OR empty, or when an environment identity is empty.
* `mint` requires a `SuccessfulReplay`, whose constructor is private and whose only producer needs
  a `ReplayResult` that only `Concrete.Proof.replay` can produce. So the receipt binds a kernel run
  the same way it binds a subject: not by recording a claim about one, but by being unable to exist
  without one.

This is the same move Register C made for status composition and `proofSubjectDigestV2` made for
incomplete facts: make the bad state unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged. A guard that
must be remembered is a guard that will eventually be forgotten, and a receipt minted from
partial evidence is indistinguishable from one minted from complete evidence — which is precisely
the failure a receipt exists to prevent.

## What it binds, and why each is separate

Four environment identities rather than one blob, because they fail independently and a consumer
needs to know WHICH moved:

| field | binds | a change means |
|---|---|---|
| `toolchainId` | the Lean/compiler version the proof was checked under | the checker changed; the proof may not replay |
| `workspaceId` | the deterministic workspace root | the proof was established somewhere else |
| `importsId` | the transitive import surface | something the proof could see has changed |
| `schemaVersion` | this envelope's own format | the receipt cannot be compared field-wise |

`schemaVersion` is in the bytes for the reason `v2:` is in the subject digest: a receipt written
under an older envelope must read as a DIFFERENT SCHEMA rather than as a mismatch, so it becomes
`needs_recheck` and not `stale`. Without it, the first envelope change would report every stored
receipt as a failed proof.

## What this does NOT do

It does not replay anything, and as of 2026-08-16 it cannot pretend to: minting takes a
`SuccessfulReplay` token, so a receipt minted without a replay — a claim about a proof nobody ran —
does not typecheck. What remains open is the other direction: nothing in the production pipeline
mints yet, so no stored receipt affects any status. Until it does, these are helper materials with
their authority enforced, not evidence in use.

/-- A proof-evidence receipt. Every field is bound; there is no partial receipt.

    Construct with `mint` only — the fields are public for reading and pattern-matching, but
    building one directly would let a caller assemble the very state minting refuses. -/
structure ProofEvidenceReceipt where
  /-- PRIVATE constructor. Without it, "minting is the only constructor" was simply false: any
      caller could assemble a receipt with an empty subject, no bindings and the CURRENT schema
      version — which would then read as comparable. The gate in this repo demonstrated the
      bypass while claiming the invariant held.

      Projections stay public; only construction is closed. -/
  private mk ::
  /-- This envelope's format. Compared BEFORE the contents, so an older receipt is
      `needs_recheck` rather than a failed comparison. -/
  schemaVersion : String
  /-- The v2 subject digest the evidence was established against. -/
  subjectDigest : String
  /-- What the proof relies on, derived from the theorem rather than declared. -/
  edge : DependencyEdge
  /-- One digest per named table, all present by construction. `Option` deliberately absent:
      an unbound table has no representation inside a receipt.

      **Ordering is NORMALIZED, not semantic**, and stating which is the point. The pairs
      arrive in Lean's traversal order, which is deterministic today and is not a promise —
      it is an artifact of how `getUsedConstants` happens to walk an expression. A durable
      receipt cannot rest on that: the same dependency set discovered in a different order
      would serialize differently and compare unequal, reporting drift where there is none.

      So `ReceiptMaterial.of?` sorts by table identity. The consequence to be aware of: order carries no
      information, and two receipts differing only in the ORDER of the same pairs are the
      same receipt. What order cannot hide is a SWAP — exchanging two tables' digests changes
      which name is paired with which value, and that survives sorting. -/
  tableBindings : List (Name × String)
  /-- The DEPENDENCY ROOT this evidence was established over, as the digest of the validated root
      preimage. Named by the authority criterion and absent until 2026-08-16: without it a receipt
      binds the tables a theorem mentions and says nothing about the CLOSURE the claim rests on, so
      a change deep in that closure — a callee's subject digest moving, an edge kind changing — left
      the receipt reading current. The root already refuses to compute over incomplete material, so
      binding its digest inherits every one of those refusals. -/
  dependencyRoot : String
  /-- The THEOREM ARTIFACT the claim was replayed from. A subject digest says which function was
      proved; this says which proof term did it. Two different proofs of the same statement are
      different artifacts, and a receipt that could not tell them apart would survive a proof being
      replaced by a weaker one that happens to typecheck. -/
  theoremArtifact : String
  /-- Whether the closure crosses a trusted boundary, and WHICH boundaries. Carried as data rather
      than folded into the digest so a consumer can read the assumption without recomputing it: an
      unconditional `proved_by_lean` and a `proved_by_lean_modulo_trusted` must not be the same
      receipt with a different summary line. Sorted, for the reason the table bindings are. -/

/-! ## The three environment identities

The receipt REFUSES an empty identity, so until something produces these no receipt can mint —
fail-closed, and loud. These are those producers.

Each is a digest over versioned canonical bytes rather than a display string, and each is
deliberately independent of the machine it ran on, because clean-machine reproducibility is a
completion requirement: an identity containing an absolute path would make every receipt
un-replayable anywhere else, which is the opposite of what binding the environment is for. -/

/-- The toolchain the proof was checked under: compiler version AND Lean toolchain.

    Both, not either. The compiler decides what the subject IS; Lean decides what a proof of it
    MEANS. A receipt that pinned only one would survive a change to the other, and
    `tableValueDigest`'s structural rendering is explicitly toolchain-relative — that limit is
    only acceptable because this exists. -/
def toolchainIdOf (compilerVersion leanToolchain : String) : String :=
  shortHash ("toolchainV1:" ++ toString compilerVersion.length ++ ":" ++ compilerVersion
             ++ "|lean:" ++ toString leanToolchain.length ++ ":" ++ leanToolchain)

/-- The workspace, identified by its PACKAGE identity rather than its path.

    A filesystem path is not a workspace identity: it differs between two checkouts of the same
    commit, so receipts would disagree across machines while describing identical evidence, and
    an identical path on a different machine would wrongly agree. Package name plus the module
    set is reproducible from the source alone.

    Modules are SORTED, so discovery order cannot enter the identity. -/
def workspaceIdOf (packageName : String) (moduleNames : List String) : String :=
  let mods := (moduleNames.mergeSort (· ≤ ·)).map (fun m => "m" ++ toString m.length ++ ":" ++ m)
  shortHash ("workspaceV1:" ++ toString packageName.length ++ ":" ++ packageName
             ++ "|n" ++ toString moduleNames.length ++ ":" ++ String.join mods)

/-- The import closure a proof could see, as (module, digest) pairs.

    Names alone would not move when an imported module's CONTENT changes, which is the same
    defect `tableValueDigest` exists to prevent one level down. Sorted by module name for the
    reason the workspace's module list is: import order is not part of what a proof depends on,
    but import CONTENT is. -/
def importsIdOf (imports : List (String × String)) : String :=
  let ps := (imports.mergeSort (fun a b => a.1 ≤ b.1)).map fun (m, d) =>
    "i" ++ toString m.length ++ ":" ++ m ++ "=" ++ toString d.length ++ ":" ++ d
  shortHash ("importsV1:n" ++ toString imports.length ++ ":" ++ String.join ps)

/-- The current envelope format. Bumping this makes every stored receipt `needs_recheck`,
    which is the intended behaviour and the reason the field exists. -/
def receiptSchemaVersion : String := "receiptV1"

/-- Receipt material that has passed every field and consistency check, and nothing more.

    THIS IS NOT A RECEIPT, and the separation is the point. Validating the material a receipt would
    record is a different question from whether a kernel ever accepted the theorem, and fusing them
    into one function meant the second question had no answerer at all: `mint?` took the theorem
    artifact as a plain `String`, so any caller could name a theorem nobody had replayed and receive
    a well-formed receipt for it.

    So the two are split. `ReceiptMaterial.of?` answers "is this material complete and
    self-consistent" — pure, cheap, and the subject of most of the tests. `ProofEvidenceReceipt.mint`
    answers "may this become evidence", and it is total: by the time it is called there is nothing
    left to refuse, because it can only be reached holding a `SuccessfulReplay`.

    Private constructor for the same reason the receipt has one: `of?` really is the only producer,
    and validated material that could be assembled directly would validate nothing. -/

      or missing facts;

    which cannot be constructed without a `ReplayResult`, which `Concrete.Proof.replay` is the only
    producer of. That chain is what makes

        unchecked facts -> ProofEvidenceReceipt

    fail to TYPECHECK rather than fail at runtime. There is no argument a caller can pass to claim a
    kernel ran; the only way to say it is to have done it.

    The artifact and the toolchain are taken from the token rather than from parameters, so a receipt
    cannot name a theorem other than the one replayed, or a toolchain other than the one that checked
    it. Those were the two fields a caller could previously simply assert. -/

/-! ## Storage: a receipt that has left the process is no longer evidence

A minted `ProofEvidenceReceipt` carries authority, because obtaining one required a kernel run. A
receipt READ BACK FROM A FILE carries none: the file is ordinary bytes that anything can write.
Modelling both as the same type would make the forgery trivial — decode a hand-written file and hold
a value indistinguishable from one the kernel earned.

So they are different types. `StoredReceipt` is what decoding produces, it has no minting path, and
the only thing it can do is be COMPARED against freshly computed material. That is what "a stored
receipt alone is never current status" means, expressed so a consumer cannot ignore it. -/

/-- Canonical bytes for a receipt. Field-tagged and line-oriented rather than positional, so a
    decoder can name a missing field instead of silently shifting every value by one.

    Repeated fields are already sorted inside the receipt, so the bytes are reproducible from the
    receipt alone. -/

    -- UNESCAPED. `s!"{n}"` renders a `Name` in Lean's display form, so a single component
    -- containing dots comes out as «Concrete.Proof.elfFns» — and decoding read the guillemets back
    -- as part of the name, so every receipt disagreed with itself the instant it was written. The
    -- store holds the classification table's STRINGS, which is what `edgeEvidenceOfRow` built these
    -- names from; it is not a structured Lean name and must not pretend to be.

       , s!"workspace {r.workspaceId}"
       , s!"imports {r.importsId}" ])

/-- Why a stored receipt could not be decoded.

    PARTIAL DECODING IS THE ATTACK. A decoder that fills missing fields with defaults produces a
    receipt that compares equal to another defaulted one, so two unrelated claims agree — the same
    "empty string is not unknown" failure the mint refusals exist for. Every one of these is a
    refusal rather than a repair. -/

      mismatch: the format changed, and the program may not have. -/

      whole file. -/
  | missingField (name : String)
  /-- A required field appears twice. Taking either is a decoder choosing which claim to believe. -/
  | duplicateField (name : String)
  /-- A line whose key this decoder does not know. Refused rather than skipped: an unknown key is
      either a newer format or an attempt to smuggle state past the comparison, and skipping makes
      both look like a clean parse. -/

  /-- A field present but unusable — an empty value, or an edge tag outside the vocabulary. -/
  | malformedField (name : String) (value : String)
  /-- The store holds more than one record for this subject, and they do not agree. Reporting one of
      them as current would let a reader conclude a claim is receipt-backed from a store that
      contradicts itself — and a consumer that picked one would be choosing which claim to believe.
      Zero and several are equally unusable, which is the same disposition `validatedRowOf` gives an

/-- A receipt read back from storage. NOT evidence.

    Deliberately a different type from `ProofEvidenceReceipt`. Minting one of those required a
    `SuccessfulReplay`, so holding one means a kernel ran; this came out of a file, and a file is
    bytes anything can write. There is no function from `StoredReceipt` to `ProofEvidenceReceipt`
    and there must not be — the way to turn a stored receipt into evidence is to replay and mint a

/-- Is a stored receipt still current against freshly computed material?

    Schema is checked FIRST and separately: an older envelope is not comparable at all, and
    answering `false` there would mean "the proof went stale", which is a claim about the
    program rather than about the format. Callers must branch on `comparable` before reading
    this — the two questions have different repairs, which is the same distinction
    `needsRecheck` draws against `stale`.

    Everything the receipt binds participates. A change to a table's body moves its digest; a
    different toolchain, workspace or import closure moves those identities; a swapped pair of
    table digests changes which name carries which value and survives the sort. Any of them
    means the recorded evidence was established against something other than what is here now. -/

/-- Thin wrapper: a STORED receipt's currency, through the same comparison.

    This is the only thing a stored receipt can do. It cannot become evidence, it cannot be minted
    from, and it cannot make a claim proved on its own — it can only agree or disagree with material
    computed fresh from the program right now. A receipt swapped onto another claim's name in the
    storage file disagrees here, because the subject digest is compared rather than the file key. -/

/-- A stored receipt is comparable only when it was written under this envelope version.
    Distinct from "the contents differ" for the same reason `needsRecheck` is distinct from
    `stale`: the format changed, and the program may not have. -/
def ProofEvidenceReceipt.comparable (r : ProofEvidenceReceipt) : Bool :=
  r.schemaVersion == receiptSchemaVersion

/-- What a stored receipt is worth against current material. ONE value, not two booleans.

    `comparable` and `isCurrentAgainst` are each correct and had to be called in the right
    order: schema first, then contents. That is a predicate a consumer must remember, and this
    file already contains one lesson about predicates that must be remembered — the receipt's
    own invariant was documentation until the constructor was closed. A consumer that reads
    them out of order reports "the proof went stale" when the ENVELOPE changed, which is a
    claim about the program rather than about the format.

    So the sequencing lives here, once:

      `needsRecheck`  written under a different envelope — not comparable, and NOT a statement
                      about the program. Repair: re-verify and re-record.
      `notCurrent`    same envelope, and something it binds has moved. Repair: fix or re-prove.
      `current`       same envelope, everything it binds matches. -/
