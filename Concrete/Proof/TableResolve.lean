# Resolving a hand-back table NAME to its entries

The blocker for per-edge correspondence was stated as "the compiler cannot check table membership,
because `FnTable` values exist only Lean-side and the hand-back carries a name and a whole-table
digest". The second half is true. The first half was WRONG, and the mistake was mine: the compiler
IS a Lean program, and these tables are ordinary Lean definitions inside it. Nothing needs to be
evaluated at elaboration time and crossed over as data — the value is already linked in. The only
missing piece was a mapping from the hand-back's NAME to the value.

So this is a dispatch, not a generator change, and it removes the `evalExpr` work that was recorded
as the next blocker.

**Seven of the eight tables named by the checked-in hand-back are in `Concrete/Proof/Proof.lean` and
resolve here. The eighth (`Examples.ProofPatterns.Proofs.combineFns`) lives under `proofs/`, outside
the compiler build, and CANNOT resolve** — it gets a named refusal rather than silence, because a
table the compiler cannot read is a dependency it cannot check, which must refuse rather than pass.

      the compiler build (as `Examples.ProofPatterns.Proofs.combineFns` is), or the dispatch below

      that cannot be checked. -/

  /-- The supplied entries do not hash to the digest recorded beside them. The row is stale, was
      edited, or its digest was copied from another table — all indistinguishable from here, and all
      equally disqualifying. Detects CORRUPTION of the recorded pair; it is not an independent
      validation of the material, since the same producer computes both sides. -/

    A DISPATCH ON FULLY-QUALIFIED NAMES, matching what the classification generator emits. Kept

/-- How much a table's entry evidence is worth.

    NOT cosmetic. `compilerLinked` means the compiler held the `FnTable` and RECOMPUTED every body
    digest from the actual `PFnDef.body`, refusing on disagreement. `generatorAsserted` means it
    holds digests emitted by the generator and no bodies, so it cannot recompute anything — the
    evidence is trusted rather than checked. Collapsing the two would let a weaker fact be reported
    as the stronger one, which is the failure this codebase keeps finding. -/

/-- What is structurally wrong with an external row's entry list, or `none`.

    SEPARATED FROM LOOKUP so it is testable. A probe that can only reach this through
    `entryEvidenceWithProvenance` can only exercise the checked-in rows, which are well-formed — so
    "malformed external rows are rejected" would be asserted against data containing none. Two
    earlier probes did worse than that: one filtered a local list and the other compared
    `entryTableDigest x` with itself, so both passed without touching this code at all. -/

/-- The SCOPED membership of a named table, or a named refusal.

    THE JOIN KEY IS A `DefinitionIdentity`, so this is the question the evidence join asks and
    `tableContainsCallee` cannot answer: that one keys on a source NAME, which denotes different
    functions in different programs.

    Two routes, and the difference is retained rather than smoothed over. An IN-COMPILER table is
    held by value, so its attestations are read directly and every body digest is recomputed from
    the actual `PFnDef.body` by `scopedEntryEvidence`. An OUT-OF-BUILD table cannot be held without
    an import cycle, so its site's attestations cross as generator-asserted data — the identities are
    the ones the site bound, but nothing here re-derives them from a body.

    A table that is neither is a REFUSAL, never an empty membership: "holds nothing" and "cannot be
    read" are different answers, and returning the first for the second is how an unreadable
    dependency silently reads as an absent one. -/

/-- Does the named table hold a MODEL of this declaration, by NAME?

    **NOT THE EVIDENCE JOIN, and it must never become it again.** This asks a name-level question,
    and a source name denotes different functions in different programs: `elf_header` and
    `main_drifted` declare the same `main.check_magic`, and this returns `true` for both. The
    evidence join asks `scopedEntryEvidenceForTable` + `scopedEvidenceContains` instead, which
    compares all four identity components — and when that replaced this function, four edges of a
    drifted program stopped being justified by another program's table.

    What remains legitimate here is the BOOTSTRAP question: can this table ever bind a reference for
    this declaration? The attestation manifest asks it, because a table cannot be attested until its
    references exist and the references come from the manifest — a scoped check at that point would
    refuse every reference needed to escape the bootstrap. The rename says which question it is.

    Returns the refusal rather than a Bool when the table cannot be read: "no" and "cannot tell" are
    different answers, and collapsing them would let an unreadable table read as a genuine absence. -/
