# Production receipt issuance (R-0004 package 3)

Receipts existed and nothing minted them. The envelope was closed, the minting authority was closed,
and the production pipeline still had no path from "the kernel accepted this" to a stored fact — so
`ProofEvidenceReceipt` was, honestly described, a well-tested helper type. This module is the path.

WHY THE COMPILER CAN DO THIS AT ALL. Edge classification reads a theorem's ELABORATED type, which
exists only while Lean is elaborating with the proof modules imported, and the compiler imports
neither (`Examples` imports `Concrete`, so importing the proofs from `Concrete` would be a cycle).
The answer is therefore computed at generation time and checked in as `ClassificationTable`, whose
freshness two gates re-derive from the live environment. Issuance reads it through `validatedRowOf`,
so a row that failed structural validation cannot classify anything.

WHAT ISSUANCE IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO is invent any of the four inputs. Each comes from exactly one
producer already used elsewhere, and each refuses on its own terms:

| input | producer | refuses when |
|---|---|---|
| the kernel accepted it | `SuccessfulReplay.of?` | not accepted, unbound, interrupted, unreplayed, fallback workspace |
| what the theorem depends on | `validatedRowOf` | absent, ambiguous, or malformed row |
| what was proved | `ProofCoreEntry.subjectDigest` | facts absent or incomplete |
| what the claim rests on | `dependencyRootMaterial` | any incomplete or unclassified closure |

Every one of those refusals is REPORTED, not skipped. A claim that cannot receive a receipt must say
which of the four inputs was missing, because "no receipt" and "receipt withheld for this reason" are
different facts and only the second is actionable.

    These come from the project, not from the replay: the workspace identity is over the package's
    declared name and module set, and the import closure is over module digests. The replay knows
    which Lake workspace it ran in and which modules it imported by NAME, which is not the same
    thing — so they are supplied, and the toolchain half is NOT, because that one the replay does
    know and a caller must not be able to disagree with it. -/

/-- Why one claim did not receive a receipt.

    the same shape as the diagnostics this project keeps replacing: true, unactionable, and equally
    consistent with every cause. -/

  /-- The claim's own status is not `proved`. Caught on the drift fixture the day issuance landed:
      `elf_header_drifted` is a DIFFERENT program sharing every declaration name with `elf_header`,
      and issuance minted four receipts for it — two of them for `stale` claims, whose bodies had
      changed since the proof was linked. The token says the kernel accepted a THEOREM; it says
      nothing about whether that theorem still proves THIS body. Binding the current subject digest
      to a theorem that proved the previous one is precisely the forgery a receipt exists to
      prevent, so the composed authority verdict gates issuance. -/

      on. -/

DIGEST against material computed fresh — the name never enters the verdict. -/

/-! ## The V1 -> V2 subject-digest migration (R-0004 package 3)

Every stored `#[proof_fingerprint]` in the corpus is a V1 value: a body-only fingerprint that answers
a weaker question than the V2 subject digest, which also binds the declaration's signature, contracts,
capabilities and constant environment. Activating V2 makes every stored V1 value NOT COMPARABLE at
once — correctly, since it was established against a different question — so activation without
migration would turn the whole corpus `needs_recheck` in a single commit.

The migration is therefore: replay each link, and for those the kernel accepts AND whose own body is
still the one their proof was pinned to, record the V2 digest computed FROM THE PROGRAM.

WHAT CANNOT BE MIGRATED, and why it matters more than what can. A STALE link is pinned to a body that
no longer exists. There is no honest V2 value to write for it: recording the CURRENT digest would
assert that a proof was established against a body it was never checked against — manufacturing
freshness, which is the exact forgery this whole package exists to prevent. Such a link keeps its V1
value and becomes `needs_recheck` on activation, which is the truthful verdict: recorded under an
older envelope, body since moved, re-verify and re-record.
