/-! # Typed proof-dependency edges (R-0004 step 6)

What a caller RELIES ON when it depends on a callee, and therefore what
invalidates it. Four kinds, and the kind is DERIVED from what the theorem
actually uses — never selected by an author:

| edge | the caller relies on | invalidated by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contract` | the callee's proved contract | that contract, or the callee's proof receipt, changing |
| `body` | the exact callee implementation | the callee's body / type / semantic digest changing |
| `trusted` | a declared trust boundary | the boundary changing; and the trust PROPAGATES |
| `missing` | nothing validated | always: the caller is `depsNotCurrent` |

Deriving rather than declaring is the whole point. A mode flag would let an
author assert a relationship the proof does not have — claim `contract` while the
proof unfolds a concrete table, and an implementation change that preserves the
contract would then not stale a caller that actually depends on the body.

## Why the signal is structural, not textual

A `contract` proof quantifies over the table: `∀ (fns : FnTable), …`, so it holds
for ANY table meeting its hypotheses and no callee body can affect it. A `body`
proof names concrete tables, so it is about those exact entries.

Source text cannot tell these apart — `fns` and `combineFns` are both just
identifiers on the page. The distinction exists only after elaboration, in whether
the `FnTable`-typed subterm is a bound variable or a constant.

Measured over the corpus before building this: 271 theorems depend on an
`FnTable`; 113 quantify over it, 158 name constants, and ZERO do both. No
tie-break rule is needed because no theorem needs one.

## `trusted` and `missing` come from elsewhere

Those two are not properties of the theorem's type. A dependency is `trusted`
because the callee declares a trust boundary, and `missing` because nothing
validated it. They are recorded here so consumers handle four cases rather than
two, and so `trusted`'s obligation is stated once: it may count as CURRENT for
traversal, but its trust propagates into the caller's evidence assumptions — a
proof reaching one records `proved_by_lean_modulo_trusted`, never unqualified
`proved_by_lean`.

## Future owner

Per the roadmap this belongs under `Concrete/Proof/Core/DependencyEdge.lean`,
with the classifier in `Concrete/Proof/Extract/DependencyEdges.lean`. That split
depends on R-0114-R-0118 (the import-layer work), so it lands flat here for now
with the intended home recorded rather than forgotten.

  /-- The classification has not been PERFORMED. Distinct from `missing`, and the distinction is
      the same one `needsRecheck` draws against `stale`: `missing` asserts that nothing validates
      this dependency, which is a claim about the dependency; `unclassified` says only that we
      have not asked, which is a claim about our own state.

      The compiler cannot mint `contract` or `body` on its own — that split needs
      `classifyTheorem`, which reads a theorem's elaborated type and lives in `MetaM` on the Lean
      side. Without this constructor the compiler's honest answer would have to be spelled
      `missing`, which asserts something stronger than it knows and would be indistinguishable
      from a genuinely unvalidated dependency once the Lean side DID answer.

      Both fail closed, so nothing is weakened by having two. What differs is the repair: `missing`
      needs a proof, `unclassified` needs the classification hand-back to run. -/

/-! ## Canonical table-ENTRY evidence (R-0004 slice 6, blocker c prerequisite)

A whole-table digest answers "did this table change". It cannot answer "does this table CONTAIN
that callee", and correspondence needs the second: a `body` edge is justified only when the bound
table holds the exact callee implementation. Digest and membership are different questions, and
one has been standing in for the other.

So entry-level material: per entry, the callable IDENTITY and the subject it was extracted from.
`PFnDef` already carries both — `identity : PFnIdentity` and `sourceBodyDigest` — so this reads
what exists rather than inventing a parallel record.

**Whole-table digests remain necessary**, and this does not replace them. A dynamic index can
reach ANY entry, so a dependency on a dynamically-indexed table is a dependency on all of it;
entry evidence answers membership for the statically-known case and cannot narrow the dynamic
one. Both, for different questions. -/

/-- One entry's correspondence material: which callable, and which subject it came from. -/
structure TableEntryEvidence where
  callee : CallableId
  /-- The V1 SOURCE-BODY digest, and the name says V1 because that is what it holds.
      `PFnDef.sourceBodyDigest` is `sourceBodyDigestV1`: it covers the extracted BODY and binds
      no typed signature, no contracts, no selected specification, no claim scope.
      An earlier version of this field was called `subjectDigest` and documented as "which
      subject it came from" — reinterpreting a V1 body digest as the frozen V2 subject. A
      signature or contract change would leave such evidence looking current, and the eventual
      per-edge join would then be exact over the WRONG subject identity.

      `none` is carried rather than defaulted: an entry whose provenance is unrecorded must not
      compare equal to one whose provenance is recorded and happens to match.

      **A VERIFIED value, and `String` rather than `Option String` for that reason.**
      This field used to be optional and merely COPIED from `PFnDef.sourceBodyDigest`, which made
      two bad states representable: an entry with no provenance, and an entry whose stored
      provenance describes a body it no longer holds. The second is the dangerous one — a body
      could be substituted while keeping its callable identity AND its stored digest, and the join
      still bound, because every leg compared metadata against metadata and nothing ever read the
      body.

      Now `tableEntryEvidence` RECOMPUTES from `PFnDef.body` and refuses the whole table unless the
      stored digest agrees, so a value here has been checked against the actual body. There is no
      constructor for an unverified one. -/

/-! ## Scoped membership — the DefinitionIdentity-keyed form

`tableEntryEvidence` keys on `CallableId`, which measurement showed is a source NAME: two packages
may define `main.validate_header` and a shared table could match the wrong one. This is the same
question asked of the scoped identity instead.

**A table with no attestations is LEGACY**, not empty. It evaluates fine — models are all evaluation
needs — but it cannot say which source definitions it describes, so it cannot participate in a scoped
join and yields `needs_recheck`. That is a refusal to re-derive, not one to argue with: the missing
scope is exactly what would distinguish two same-named definitions. -/

    ambiguous, unclassified and mismatched to be named refusals, "never discarded by `filterMap`, a
    first-match lookup, or an advisory-only warning". This function previously returned `Option`, so
    all six checks below collapsed to `none` — the recompute was right and the reason was thrown
    away. A caller could not distinguish "this table holds a SUBSTITUTED body" from "this table has
    an entry without identity", and those warrant different responses: the first is a possible
    attack, the second is an incomplete build.

    `bodyMismatch` is the `mismatched` set. It carries the callee and both digests, because "a body

/-- The canonical ENTRY-DERIVED table identity digest.

    The table digest the hand-back already carries is `shortHash ("tableV1:" ++ name ++ toString v)`
    over the SYNTACTIC term at generation time. The compiler cannot reproduce that — it has no term,
    only a linked value or a row of data — so it has never been able to verify that a name it
    resolved denotes the table a theorem actually bound. This digest can be recomputed from either
    side, which is the property that was missing.

    BINDS THE TABLE'S OWN IDENTITY, not just its membership. Without the name in the preimage, a
    valid digest could be copied from another table and would verify — name, entry list and digest
    must agree, and none may be substituted independently.

    BINDS SCHEMA AND SCOPE per entry. `tableEntryEvidence` accepts only
    `sourceBodyDigestV1`/`body_only` and refuses anything else, so these are the sole accepted
    values today; binding them anyway means a future schema whose digests happen to collide cannot
    silently satisfy a check written for this one.

    CANONICALLY ORDERED BY IDENTITY before hashing, so declaration or traversal order cannot enter
    the value: two producers walking the same table in different orders must agree, or the digest
    measures iteration rather than membership. Reordering is therefore EQUIVALENT by construction,
    while adding, removing, duplicating or altering an entry is not.

    LENGTH-PREFIXED per field, so `("ab","c")` and `("a","bc")` cannot serialize alike.

    **Agreement does NOT upgrade evidence, and is not an independent check.** Generator and
    compiler run this same implementation, so agreement establishes canonical-encoding consistency
    and the binding between a table's name, its entries and its stored digest — enough to catch
    corruption, staleness and a copied digest. It establishes nothing about the formula's
    correctness, the generator's correctness, or whether the entries describe real bodies. A
    consistently-altered entry list and digest verify structurally, by design. Independence would
    require a standalone verifier implementing this canonical format separately. -/

Lives HERE rather than in `DependencyEdges` because `ProofCore` must produce the manifest and
`DependencyEdges` imports `ProofCore` — putting it there made the producer a cycle. The types are
pure data over `CallableId`, so this is their natural home anyway.
-/

/-- A closed, validated map from callable identity to IMPLEMENTATION digest.

    **Why implementation and not proof subject.** The frozen V2 subject includes the selected
    specification and claim scope, which describe what a particular proof LINK claims. One
    callable can carry several proof links, so `CallableId -> ProofSubjectDigestV2` is not a
    function and a join on it is ill-defined. The IMPLEMENTATION digest excludes spec and scope,
    so it is one per callable — which is what a table entry needs, since an entry describes an
    implementation and does not change when a different specification is pointed at it.

    **Why a closed type and not a callback.** The previous version took
    `CallableId -> Option String`, so any caller could mint a "bound" entry from any non-empty
    string — the private constructor required only non-emptiness, not provenance. The tests
    passed `"v2:abc"` and proved exactly that. A private constructor guarding a value the caller
    supplies is not a guard.

    Constructor is private, and so is `ofRows`; `ofImplementations` is the only way in, and it
    computes the digests rather than accepting them. -/

    this callable" indistinguishably from a callable that genuinely has none.

    This is a predicate, not a constructor, and the split is the point. It says nothing about

/-- Build a manifest from raw rows. **PRIVATE, and that is the containment.**

    It validates FORMAT ONLY: a caller cannot pass `"v2:abc"`, but can pass thirty-two zeros. While
    this was public, "validated manifest" meant "well-formed hex", and the join's whole guarantee
    rested on a value any caller could invent. `ofImplementations` is the way in — it takes inputs
    and computes the digests — and this exists only for it to route through, so the duplicate and
    format refusals stay in one place.

    Made private 2026-08-12. The format refusals it used to be tested through are now tested via
    `rowsWellFormed`, so nothing was lost by closing it; the compile-failure controls in
    `check_dependency_edges.sh` pin that it stays closed. -/

    : Option ImplementationManifest :=
  if !ImplementationManifest.rowsWellFormed rows then none
  else some (ImplementationManifest.mk rows)

/-- Build a manifest from COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS, computing both digests internally.

    This is the entry point a caller should use, and the reason is provenance rather than
    convenience: `ofRows` takes digests, and a digest handed to a constructor is a digest the
    constructor cannot vouch for — it validates that thirty-two hex characters are thirty-two hex
    characters. Here the caller supplies INPUTS and the digests are computed from them, so there is
    nowhere to put an invented value.

    Still routed through `ofRows`, so the duplicate-callable and canonical-format refusals apply
    unchanged. Those are not redundant once digests are computed: a duplicate means the manifest is
    not the function it claims to be, and a malformed digest from the AUTHORITATIVE producer is a
    different failure from a forged one — worth refusing rather than assuming cannot happen.

    LIMIT, stated because the type looks stronger than it is: this inherits exactly the guarantees
    of `CompleteImplementation`. The `facts`/`callable` mispairing is refused; a `body` or
    `extracted` belonging to another entry is NOT detectable, because neither carries identity. See
    the named gap on `CompleteImplementation`. -/

    : Option ImplementationManifest :=
  ImplementationManifest.ofRows (impls.map fun ci =>
    (ci.callable, ci.sourceBodyComponent, ci.implementationComponent))

/-! ## Manifest completeness, self-denominating

`filterMap` launders. A producer that drops what it cannot handle returns a SMALLER manifest that
looks complete, because the only record of how many rows there should have been is the number of rows
there are. The denominator has to be stored, not inferred from the numerator.

So the producer returns every eligible identity it set out to cover, the rows it built, and a NAMED
refusal for each identity it could not — and a manifest fit for correspondence exists only when the
refusal list is empty and the rows account for exactly the expected identities. -/

/-- Why one identity produced no manifest row. Named, because "absent" is the one answer that must
    never stand in for the others: an entry with no facts and an entry whose evidence failed
    validation are different failures, and a count cannot tell them apart. -/
inductive ManifestRefusal where
  /-- No checked declaration facts were captured for this identity. -/

  | evidenceMissing
  /-- No extracted proof-model body, so no comparable source-body component. -/
  | extractedMissing

/-- The outcome of trying to build a manifest for a whole program.

    `expected` is the DENOMINATOR, recorded up front. Every eligible identity appears either in
    `impls` or in `refusals`, never in neither and never in both. -/
structure ManifestResult where
  expected : List CallableId
  impls    : List CompleteImplementation
  refusals : List (CallableId × ManifestRefusal)

/-- Total accounted-for identities. Equal to `expected.length` when the result is well-formed; a
    difference means the producer lost an identity, which is the failure this type exists to make
    visible rather than silent. -/
def ManifestResult.accounted (r : ManifestResult) : Nat := r.impls.length + r.refusals.length

/-- The manifest, ONLY if the result is complete — or `none`, with no partial answer available.

    Three conditions, each refusing for a different reason:
    - **no refusals**: a refusal means some identity has no row, and the join cannot distinguish
      "this callable has no implementation" from "we failed to build its row";
    - **rows account for exactly the expected identities**: this is the anti-`filterMap` condition.
      Comparing against a stored denominator is the whole point; comparing rows against themselves
      is what the old producer effectively did;
    - **well-formed and duplicate-free**, via `ofImplementations`, which still applies.

    Order-sensitive equality is deliberate and is not merely convenient: the producer walks entries
    in one order and appends in that order, so a permutation means an identity was reordered relative
    to its source, which is a bug in the producer rather than a harmless difference. -/

/-- A table entry bound to its authoritative IMPLEMENTATION digest.

    `implDigest` is a plain `String` with a private constructor, so an entry without an
    authoritative implementation has no representation — and the value can only have come from a
    validated manifest, not from a caller-supplied callback. -/

/-- Join entry evidence against a CLOSED manifest, or refuse.

    Refuses the whole list when any entry has no manifest row. Dropping unbindable entries would
    shrink the membership set, and a shrunken set answers "is this callee present" with "not
    among the ones I could bind" — indistinguishable from "absent", which is what justifies
    refusing an edge. A membership list must never be able to under-report. -/

    -- without the first admits a substituted body wearing correct-looking metadata.
