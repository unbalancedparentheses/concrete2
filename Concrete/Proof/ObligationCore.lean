# ObligationCore — the typed evidence ledger (Phase 3 schema v1)

One record model for every proof / contract / runtime-safety / SMT / policy /
audit / proof-authoring surface. Reports, policies, proof workspaces, audit
bundles, and codegen gates should all read from this ledger instead of
recomputing facts in parallel walkers. See `docs/verification/OBLIGATION_CORE.md` (canonical)
and ROADMAP Phase 3.

This module establishes the schema (#1) and the single evidence/status
vocabulary (#2), and projects the existing VC-discharge ledger (`Report.VC`,
covering preconditions / postconditions / bounds / div-mod / overflow / asserts /
loop O*) into it. The contract-diagnostic and proof-link families migrate next
(Phase 3 #10-11); until then they keep their current report paths.

/-! ### Trap conditions ↔ obligation families (R-0464 / H24)

`IntArith.trapConditions` says what a checked op owes. This says which obligation family
discharges each, and the example below makes the correspondence TOTAL: a condition added to
the semantics has no family until someone names one here, and naming a family that emits no
such VC kind fails too.

That totality is the part `check_vc_bridge_register.sh` structurally could not provide. It
asserts every family GENERATOR has a register row, so a family that does not exist has no
generator to notice — which is exactly how the shift gap stayed invisible while the gate
suite was green. The direction matters: this walks from the SEMANTICS to the families, so
absence is what it detects. -/

/-- The VC kind that discharges each trap condition. Total by construction — a new
    `TrapCondition` constructor makes this a missing-case error, which is the point. -/
def familyForTrapCondition : IntArith.TrapCondition → String
  | .divisorNonZero     => "div_nonzero"
  | .quotientInRange    => "div_quotient_in_range"
  | .resultInRange      => "no_overflow"
  | .shiftAmountInRange => "shift_amount_in_range"

/-- Every trap condition in the semantics is claimed by a real obligation kind. Fails if a
    condition is added to `IntArith` without a family, or if `familyForTrapCondition` names
    a kind that is not in the canonical vocabulary. -/
example : IntArith.allTrapConditions.all
    (fun c => kindVocabulary.contains (familyForTrapCondition c)) = true := rfl

/-- And the map is injective: two conditions must not be answered by ONE obligation, which is
    the specific defect H24 was. `div_nonzero` covered `divisorNonZero` and was treated as if
    it also covered `quotientInRange`; a division discharged `b ≠ 0`, reported
    `proved_by_kernel_decision`, and aborted on `MIN / -1`. Distinct conditions, distinct
    obligations, distinct keys. -/
example : (IntArith.allTrapConditions.map familyForTrapCondition).eraseDups.length
    = IntArith.allTrapConditions.length := rfl

/-- ObligationCore schema — the one typed obligation record (Phase 3 #18d). It is
    now an `abbrev` of `Report.Obligation`: there is a SINGLE record type, hosted
    in `Report` (where `collectVCs` lives, since `ObligationCore` imports
    `Report`), and both `Report.VC` and this name refer to it. The ledger-view
    fields (`variables`, `allowedEngines`, `replay`, `policyImpact`) live on that
    one record; reports read whichever fields they need. Field names follow the
    record: `fn` (not `function`), `arithProfile` (not `semanticProfile`). -/

/-- Enrich an obligation with the ledger-view fields (Phase 3 #18d). Since the
    record is now unified, this is no longer a type conversion — it only fills the
    derived view fields (`allowedEngines`/`replay`/`policyImpact`) from the VC
    surface already present, leaving every VC field untouched. So a VC report
    rendering the result is byte-identical (it never reads the view fields), and
    the obligation-ledger sees the same derived values it did before. -/

/-- The current ObligationCore ledger: the discharged VC families enriched with

/-- `ofVC` only enriches the view fields; the VC surface is untouched, so a VC
