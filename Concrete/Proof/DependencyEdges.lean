/-! # Deriving a dependency edge from a theorem (R-0004 step 6)

The classifier. It reads the ELABORATED TYPE of a theorem and answers what that
theorem relies on, so the edge is derived from the proof rather than declared by
its author.

## The discriminator

* every `FnTable`-typed subterm is a BOUND VARIABLE → `contract`. The theorem
  holds for any table meeting its hypotheses, so no callee body can affect it.
* the type names concrete table CONSTANTS → `body`. The theorem is about those
  exact entries, and any relevant body change stales it.

Source text cannot answer this. `fns` and `combineFns` are both identifiers on the
page; the difference appears only after elaboration.

## Table-valued expressions, and why a naive test fails OPEN

A first version tested "is this a constant whose TYPE is `FnTable`". That misses a
table built inline — `eval (FnTable.ofGlobals g) …` mentions `FnTable.ofGlobals`,
a constant of FUNCTION type, so the test finds no table constant and answers
`contract` for a theorem that depends on concrete entries. Failing toward
`contract` is the unsafe direction: it says "an implementation change cannot
affect this" about a proof that an implementation change breaks.

So a constant counts as table-valued when its type RETURNS `FnTable` after any
number of arguments, not only when it IS `FnTable`. Measured when this was
written: 11 plain table definitions and 4 table-valued combinators
(`FnTable.mk`, `.ofGlobals`, `.withCallables`, and the flat constructor), and 8
theorems that mention a combinator without naming a table — all of them
metatheory about `FnTable` itself rather than claims about a program. The gap was
latent, not live, and it is closed here before it becomes live.

## What this does NOT decide

`trusted` and `missing` are not properties of the theorem's type: a dependency is
trusted because the callee declares a boundary, and missing because nothing
validated it. Those come from the callee's status, and this classifier
deliberately does not guess them — it reports what the theorem uses, and returns
`none` when the theorem depends on no table at all.

/-- A digest binding the WHOLE of a table constant, or `none` if it cannot be bound.

    **The under-approximation this exists to prevent.** A `body` edge records which tables a
    theorem names. That is not enough to stale it: the NAME does not move when an entry's
    definition changes, so a proof about `fns` stayed valid-looking after any edit inside
    `fns`. Binding only the entries a static index appears to touch would be worse than
    useless — a dynamic index can reach any entry, so the apparent subset is an
    under-approximation, and an under-approximated dependency fails OPEN.

    So this digests the constant's DEFINING VALUE, not a selection from it. Whole-by-
    construction: there is no subset to guess, and any change anywhere in the table moves it.

    `none` when the constant has no value — an axiom, an opaque, or an unavailable import.
    Refusing is the fail-closed direction and matches `shadowDepsLine`, which refuses rather
    than digesting a partial constant set. A digest over "the parts we could see" is
    indistinguishable from one over the whole thing, which is exactly how a partial
    dependency becomes an invisible one.

    LIMIT, stated because it bounds what a receipt may claim: the digest is over the
    elaborated value's structural rendering, so it is deterministic within a toolchain and
    not across toolchains. That is sufficient here only because toolchain identity is bound
    separately in the receipt envelope (slice 4); if that binding is ever dropped, this
    becomes a cross-machine reproducibility hole rather than a stable key. -/

/-! ## The classification hand-back (R-0004 slice 6, step 1)

The compiler cannot perform this classification: it reads a theorem's ELABORATED TYPE, which
exists only while Lean is elaborating. So the Lean side answers, and the answers cross to the
compiler as data. These are the producers of that data.

**A theorem that cannot be classified yields `unclassified`, never a dropped row.** Dropping is
how a dependency disappears from a root and the root then reports a confident value over
material it never saw — the same failure the migration manifest's `owner=NONE` rows exist to
prevent one layer up. Every requested name appears in the output, exactly once. -/

/-- Classify one theorem, total. `none` from `classifyTheorem` means the theorem mentions no
    table at all, which is a real answer (`contract`-like: nothing about a table can stale it)
    and distinct from "we could not look". An unknown name is `unclassified`. -/
def classifyOrUnclassified (n : Name) : MetaM EdgeEvidence := do
  match (← try classifyTheorem n catch _ => pure none) with
  | some ev => return ev
  | none    =>
    -- Distinguishing "no table dependency" from "could not classify" needs to survive here, and
    -- it does: `classifyTheorem` throwing is caught above and both land as `unclassified`, which
    -- is the fail-closed reading. A theorem that genuinely mentions no table is ALSO reported
    -- unclassified rather than `contract`, because this function cannot tell the two apart from
    -- a `none` — and inventing `contract` would assert independence from an implementation the
    -- theorem might well depend on.
    return { edge := .unclassified, tables := [], tableDigests := [], quantifiesOverTable := false }

/-- Classify every requested theorem. One row per request, in the REQUESTED order — the caller's
    order, not the environment's, so two runs over the same list agree regardless of how the
    constants happen to be stored. -/

/-- Canonical, length-prefixed serialization of a classification table.

    SORTED BY THEOREM NAME, for the reason `mint?` sorts table bindings: the caller's order is
    convenient for reading and must not enter the bytes, or the same classification discovered in
    a different order would serialize differently and compare unequal.

    Tables are rendered with their digests so a consumer can tell a `body` edge bound to specific
    entries from one that named them and bound nothing. An UNBOUND table renders as `?`, which is
    deliberately not a digest-shaped value — a consumer must not be able to mistake it for one. -/
def renderClassification (rows : List (Name × EdgeEvidence)) : String :=
  let lp := fun (t p : String) => t ++ toString p.length ++ ":" ++ p
  let sorted := rows.mergeSort (fun a b => toString a.1 ≤ toString b.1)
  let one := fun (n, ev) =>
    let tbls := ev.tableDigests.mergeSort (fun a b => toString a.1 ≤ toString b.1)
    lp "T" (toString n) ++ lp "e" ev.edge.canonical
      ++ "n" ++ toString tbls.length ++ ":"
      ++ String.join (tbls.map fun (tn, d?) => lp "t" (toString tn) ++ lp "d" (d?.getD "?"))
  "classifyV1:n" ++ toString sorted.length ++ ":" ++ String.join (sorted.map one)

/-- A digest of the theorem ITSELF — its type and its proof term.

    Without it a classification is a label floating free of what it classifies: `("T", "body")`
    stays structurally valid after `T` is reproved, restated, or replaced by a different theorem
    of the same name. The row would still parse, still merge, and still type an edge — while
    describing a theorem that no longer exists.

    The TYPE is what `classifyTheorem` reads, so a type change can change the classification and
    must move this. The VALUE is included because a re-proof with the same statement is a
    different artifact, and a receipt that binds "which proof" cannot rest on a digest that
    ignores the proof.

    Same toolchain-relativity limit as `tableValueDigest`, and acceptable for the same reason:
    the toolchain is separately bound in the receipt. -/
def theoremArtifactDigest (n : Name) : MetaM (Option String) := do
  match (← try pure (some (← getConstInfo n)) catch _ => pure none) with
  | none => return none
  | some ci =>
    -- The VALUE contributes as a structural HASH, not as rendered text. `toString` on a proof
    -- term is O(term size), and proof terms are enormous: rendering 43 of them exceeded a
    -- 28-minute budget and produced nothing. Measured, not predicted — the first version did
    -- exactly that.
    --
    -- `Expr.hash` is a cheap structural hash and keeps the property that matters here: a
    -- re-proof with the same statement moves the digest, gated by a same-type/different-proof
    -- probe.
    --
    -- WHAT THIS IS NOT, stated because the previous wording ("astronomically unlikely
    -- collision") claimed more than a 64-bit structural hash supports. `Expr.hash` is not a
    -- cryptographic identity, and passing it through `shortHash` cannot restore collision
    -- resistance that the input never had — hashing a hash adds no entropy. This is a
    -- toolchain-bound FRESHNESS TRIPWIRE, adequate against drift and accident, and NOT an
    -- adversarially robust receipt identity. Slice 8 should attack it.
    --
    -- A second known weakness: `value? = none` yields the shared marker `<opaque>`, so two
    -- opaque declarations with the same name and type are indistinguishable here. Recorded
    -- rather than papered over — an opaque artifact is exactly where a digest is least able to
    -- tell one proof from another.
    --
    -- The TYPE is still rendered in full: types are small, and the type is what
    -- `classifyTheorem` reads, so it is the part where an exact representation earns its cost.
    let valHash := match ci.value? with
      | some v => toString v.hash
      | none   => "<opaque>"
    return some (Concrete.shortHash ("thmV1:" ++ toString n ++ "|ty:" ++ toString ci.type
                                     ++ "|valh:" ++ valHash))

/-! ## Canonical table-ENTRY evidence (R-0004 slice 6, blocker c prerequisite)

A whole-table digest answers "did this table change". It cannot answer "does this table CONTAIN
that callee", and correspondence needs the second: a `body` edge is justified only when the bound
table holds the exact callee implementation. Digest and membership are different questions, and
one has been standing in for the other.

So entry-level material: per entry, the callable IDENTITY and the subject it was extracted from.
`PFnDef` already carries both — `identity : PFnIdentity` and `sourceBodyDigest` — so this reads
what exists rather than inventing a parallel record.

**Whole-table digests remain necessary**, and this does not replace them. A dynamic index can
reach ANY entry, so a dependency on a dynamically-indexed table is a dependency on all of it;
entry evidence answers membership for the statically-known case and cannot narrow the dynamic
one. Both, for different questions. -/

/-- One entry's correspondence material: which callable, and which subject it came from. -/
structure TableEntryEvidence where
  callee : CallableId
  /-- The extracted-from subject digest, when the entry records one. `none` is carried rather
      than defaulted: an entry whose provenance is unrecorded must not compare equal to one whose
      provenance is recorded and happens to match. -/
  subjectDigest : Option String
deriving Repr, BEq

/-- Entry evidence for a table, or `none` if ANY entry lacks identity.

    All-or-nothing deliberately. A partial membership list answers "is this callee present" with
    "not in the part I could read", which is indistinguishable from "absent" — and absence is
    what justifies refusing an edge. A caller cannot tell those apart from a shortened list, so
    it does not get one. This mirrors `FnTable.allIdentified`: evidence requires identity for the
    WHOLE table, not most of it. -/
def tableEntryEvidence (t : FnTable) : Option (List TableEntryEvidence) :=
  t.canonicalEntries.toList.foldl (init := some []) fun acc d =>
    match acc, d.identity.id? with
    | some rows, some cid =>
        some (rows ++ [{ callee := cid, subjectDigest := d.sourceBodyDigest.map (·.value) }])
    | _, _ => none

/-- Does this table contain the callee, by IDENTITY?

    Identity, never name: two callables can share a display name, and `PFnDef.displayName` is
    explicitly not identity. Membership decided on a rendering would be the defect R-0004 exists
    to close, appearing in the check meant to close it. -/
def entryEvidenceContains (rows : List TableEntryEvidence) (callee : CallableId) : Bool :=
  rows.any fun r => r.callee == callee

/-! ## The merge (R-0004 slice 6, step 3)

The compiler emits `unclassified` edges keyed by theorem name; Lean answers; this joins them.
It is the boundary where a partial answer becomes indistinguishable from a complete one, so it
refuses five distinct ways rather than returning a best effort.

Roots are computed only after this succeeds. A merge that silently dropped, defaulted, or
double-counted a row would hand the root builder material it could not tell from complete
material — and the root builder's own fail-closed checks cannot see a row that never arrived. -/

inductive MergeError where
  /-- A requested key came back with no classification. -/
  | unanswered (key : String)
  /-- A key was answered twice. Not "take the first": two answers for one question means the
      classifier disagrees with itself, and picking one makes the result depend on list order. -/
  | duplicateAnswer (key : String)
  /-- An answer arrived for a key nobody asked about. Its presence means the answer set was
      built from a different question set, so the whole batch is suspect — not just this row. -/
  | unknownAnswer (key : String)
  /-- The classifier returned `unclassified`, which is not an answer. Accepting it would put
      exactly the state this merge exists to eliminate into a root. -/
  | stillUnclassified (key : String)
  /-- The classifier returned `missing`: it ran and found nothing validating this dependency.
      A real answer, and not one a current root may be built from. -/
  | classifiedMissing (key : String)
deriving Repr, BEq

def MergeError.explain : MergeError → String
  | .unanswered k        => s!"no classification returned for '{k}'"
  | .duplicateAnswer k   => s!"'{k}' was classified twice — the classifier disagrees with itself"
  | .unknownAnswer k     => s!"classification returned for '{k}', which was never requested"
  | .stillUnclassified k => s!"'{k}' came back unclassified — that is not an answer"
  | .classifiedMissing k => s!"'{k}' classified as `missing`: nothing validates this dependency"

/-- Join requested keys to returned classifications, or refuse.

    EVERY refusal is a distinct constructor because the repairs differ: an unanswered key means
    the hand-back did not run over it; a duplicate means the classifier is inconsistent; an
    unknown answer means the two sides disagree about the question set; `unclassified` means the
    classification did not conclude; `missing` means it concluded there is nothing. Collapsing
    them to `none` would leave every one of those looking like "try again".

    the answers happened to be listed. -/
