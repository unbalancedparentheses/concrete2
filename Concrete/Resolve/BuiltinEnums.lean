/-! ## Compiler-provided enums — ONE owner (bug 065)

`Option` and `Result` were each defined as a local `let` in BOTH `Elab` and
`Check`, and the shadowing rule was computed twice from DIFFERENT inputs: Elab
consulted `imports.enums`, Check did not. So the two passes could hold different
beliefs about whether a user `Result` shadows the builtin.

The enum bodies happened to agree; the inputs to the rule did not. That is the
failure mode of a fact stated twice — the copies stay in step until one of them
gains a clause. Stated once here, the question stops being askable.

    Owner module, not a home of convenience. `Resolve/Intrinsic` cannot hold these
    (they are `EnumDef` VALUES and AST imports Intrinsic, so it would cycle), and
    `Frontend/AST` should not: AST declares what a program CAN say, while which
    builtins are in scope and when a user declaration shadows one is construction
    POLICY. A dedicated module can import AST without cycling and keeps the two
    kinds of fact apart. -/

/-- Does a user-declared `Result` shadow the builtin?

    Takes BOTH the module's own enums and its imported ones. Check previously
    consulted only the former, so an IMPORTED user `Result` suppressed the
    builtin in Elab and not in Check. One rule, one set of inputs. -/
