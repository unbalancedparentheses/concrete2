# View lifetime regression inputs

R-0483: open stdlib lifetime defect. These are the saved investigation sources,
retained together on 2026-09-15. They are not yet an automated passing safety gate.

| Project | Purpose | Observation |
|---|---|---|
| `control` | Read ByteCursor before consuming Bytes | Compiles; exits 65 ('A') |
| `use_after_free` | Consume Bytes, then read ByteCursor | Compiles; observed exit 0 through Ok |
| `unsafe_boundary` | User-defined pointer view without trusted/Unsafe | Rejected with E0521 |
| `text_use_after_free` | Drop String, then read Text | Accepted (check rc 0) |
| `byteview_cursor_use_after_free` | Destroy Bytes, then read `ByteView::cursor` result | Accepted (check rc 0) |
| `byteview_try_text_use_after_free` | Destroy Bytes, then read `ByteView::try_text` result | Accepted (check rc 0) |
| `byteview_byte_rejected` | Destroy Bytes, then call `ByteView::byte(&b, _)` | **Rejected with E0205** |
| `byteview_wrong_buffer_same_length` | Read a view of `a` against a *different* buffer of equal length | Accepted; returns `b`'s byte (exit 91) |
| `cursor_across_realloc` | Hold a ByteCursor across pushes that outgrow capacity — **no destroy at all** | Accepted (check rc 0) |

The first three rows are the original 2026-09-15 investigation; the last four were
added when Text and ByteView coverage was extended, and each was checked directly.

**The classification these establish.** Two defect classes and one sound design:

- *Representation* — `ByteCursor` and `Text` store a `*const u8` taken from a
  borrow, so the value outlives the borrow by construction.
- *Conversion* — `ByteView` itself stores only `off`/`len`/`buf_len` and is sound,
  but `cursor` and `try_text` extract a raw pointer and hand back a value of the
  representation class, which gives the advantage back.
- *Lifetime-sound, identity-unsound* — `ByteView::byte(&self, buf: &Bytes, i)` demands
  the buffer on every access, so destroy-then-read cannot be written: the owner is
  gone and the call does not typecheck. That makes it the positive control for the
  repair direction. It is **not** a validated accessor: `describes` compares
  `buf.len() != self.buf_len` and nothing else, so a *different* buffer of the same
  length passes the brand and is read silently. It demands an owner, not the right
  one.

**Two independent properties, and only one of them holds anywhere today.** Lifetime
(does the buffer still exist?) and identity (is it the buffer this view describes?)
fail separately. `byteview_byte_rejected` and `byteview_wrong_buffer_same_length` are
the same accessor reaching opposite verdicts, which is why both are kept.
`cursor_across_realloc` is the reason lifetime is not only about `destroy`: an
ordinary append that outgrows capacity moves the buffer with the owner still alive
and nothing consumed.

Note that `examples/byte_view/wrong_buffer` exercises only a *different-length*
buffer — the case the brand can catch. It used to report that all unsafe uses were
rejected; it now reports what it actually checked, because the same-length fixture
here is a counterexample to the broader claim.

Accept/reject here is a **compile-time** observation and is the reliable signal.
The use-after-free byte is undefined: do not assert exit zero, a changed byte, or a
crash as the safety oracle. Even an observed 65 would not make that ordering safe.
The cursor programs allocate capacity eight and push two bytes; the cursor stores
length two. `destroy(b)` frees the backing allocation and the later read uses the
retained pointer. The bounds check does not establish allocation lifetime.

To replay, build the repository compiler, then run `concrete build` from each project
directory. The first two currently produce binaries named `ctl` and `uaf`; record
their exit statuses separately from compiler success. The third must reject for
the missing Unsafe requirement. The observations above come from the supplied
investigation, not an independent replay performed when retaining these files.

At repair time, wire the control and negative case into the normal test gates:
valid access must still work and retained access after owner destruction must be
rejected or rendered safe by the new API. Preserve this original pair as historical
reproduction inputs if signatures change; a missing API alone is not a lifetime
regression test. Keep positive coverage for the replacement API and the Unsafe
negative control. Split cast and dereference probes if first-error diagnostics mask
one another.

Still uncovered: reallocation (a `push` that grows the buffer while a view is held),
content mutation under a validated `Text`, and the `buf_len` brand's behaviour against
a same-length wrong buffer. `describes` compares a length, and length equality is not
buffer identity — `byteview_byte_rejected` shows the accessor demands *an* owner, not
that it demands the *right* one.
